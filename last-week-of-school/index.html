        <p>So I thought I'd give a quick update on things since I haven't posted in like a month.</p><p>I've been really enjoying the last few weeks of school. There's basically no work to do and my grades are locked in already, so there's really nothing that's hard. I finally stopped making that stupid sandwhich that I always each for lunch (everyday Sophomore year) and now I go out to each during 2nd period photo or skipping a few classes.</p><p>In terms of coding projects, there's not much activity there to be honest. I'm still learning more about AI, and it'll be a while before I can make some real projects (I'd rather make something technically complex than another boring app). For my Calc final, I made a script to record chords and decompose it into the individual notes using Fourrier Transform. This concept is pretty cool and has a lot of applications; I saw it at Atmosic but I was never really sure what it did (or what frequency domain meant). My CS Capstone final is likely a quick script to turn a song into an image, and have a script to play a song from an image.</p><h3 id="college-stuff">College Stuff</h3><p>I finally had all my recommendation letters and videos sent to UCSB CCS Computing, which is the "graduate" CS school for undergrads. It gives you a much more personalized experience and focuses on performing research alongside regular coursework. It's pretty competitive; people have given up Stanford and Berkeley to get into this, even though I never heard of this before.</p><p>Fuey recenlty got off the waitlist for UCSB and I've been trying my best to convince him to come. I don't understand the thought-process of going with UIUC—to me, it just seems like a worse school at a worse location, but I guess it has the specific major that he wants to do.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.pacbiztimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ucsb-campus-storke-bike-circle-ucen-ocean.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="UCSB, Cal Poly, CLU all crack top 10 on U.S. News lists | Pacific Coast  Business Times" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It's like a beach resort...</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3 id="prom-and-ditch-day">Prom and Ditch Day</h3><p>Prom was pretty fun. I went with my usual group of friends and we took some pictures at Bol Park. After-party was fun too.</p><p>Ditch day was awesome. We went to Poplar Beach and walked like 15 minutes down the coast into an isolated part of the beach (where no one else would find us). There were probably a little under a hundred seniors there sleeping over in tents. Some people started a bonfire and there were games like volleyball and spikeball.</p><p>I think everyone was probably drunk or high, but that made it really easy to socialize and just talk to people I don't normally talk to. Hayden threw up in the tent, which made me really paranoid the whole night. Luckily, the tent didn't smell and nothing else happened.</p><p>I think in the middle of the night, some Paly kids were on top of the cliff throwing eggs at all of us. A few hit the tent and a few got on my jacket, but I don't think anyone was in the right headspace to care at all.</p><p>Some of us were in the "bijillionth dimension," while others were only in the 5th dimension lol. It was pretty funny listening to people talk.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ditch Day at Poplar Beach</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>A few days later, a news article appears online: "Gunn High School trashes Poplar Beach". Uh oh.</p><p>Basically, it was resolved with a really nice "sorry" letter and some volunteer effort by our Seniors to clean up all the trash and more.</p><h3 id="senior-assassin">Senior Assassin</h3><p>I can't believe I was betrayed. For the last 10 or so people in Senior Assassin, we used Life360 to track each other's locations. I saw that Fuey was right outside of Ella's house (to get Mihlaan, who was there too), and so I asked if I could wait with him. We waited and did some driving, and he tells me that there's a faster way: Shree can get us into the house since he's good friends with them. Turns out, Fuey knew that Shree had me, but still it was the only way he could get in. So I guessed he sacrificed me so that he could get his target. Wow.</p><p>A week or so later, we're hanging out at the Y, and we decide to go for his other target, Julia. We wait outside her house for a while, but then we see her parked outside of Safeway. Easy kill, we think. When we got there, the windows were open, and Julia looks at us as if she was waiting for us to come. Then, out of nowhere, McKayla pops out of the back seat and shoots Fuey as he approaches. We totally got outplayed there. I guess we were too obviously waiting outside her house, so she decided to lure us out and kill Fuey.</p><p>Anyways, Fuey complained that McKayla didn't have her location on, so the kill got reversed. He survived this round, and eventually, ended up winning the entire thing. He made $400.</p><h3 id="upcoming-stuff">Upcoming Stuff</h3><p>Wow, my last day of school was last week. I literally can't believe it; I really enjoyed PAUSD. The graduation ceremony is in a few days, and after that, my friends and I are headed straight to Portugal. No plans for the trip yet, but we have all of our housing and transportation booked. Other than that, I signed up to be a DoorDash driver (my parents wanted me to get a job and this seems the easiest), but I also just sent an application to In-N-Out since they pay way more.</p><p>I'm really excited for college. Hopefully I get a double with a great roommate and I can bring my gaming PC. I also want to do some morning runs by the beach, as well as lots of gym days. I think it'll be really fun.</p><p>Also, I'm looking forward to all the grad parties. At the one with our close family friends, I got a few really good books. I've already read "Atomic Habits" and "How To Win Friends and Influence People," but I'm looking forward to reading "I Will Teach You To Be Rich" over the summer. Stay posted for some book summaries!</p>
