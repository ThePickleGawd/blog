With only 7 weeks to go, I have a lot of work before I am ready to get all of my LunchTrak tags manufactured and shipped. One of the biggest things to do beforehand, however, is to get a final invoice ready for the school to review and decide whether they want to pay. I&apos;ve always had an estimate of how much the parts would cost overall, but I will need a more succinct list. That&apos;s where the Bill of Materials (or BOM) comes in. The BOM is mainly used to tell the manufacturers what parts I want to use in my PCB and where they should source them, but it also helps give a final price for the board. Originally, I was too lazy to research which parts to use, and that is partly because I didn&apos;t know where to look. Luckily, some Redditors suggested <a href="https://octopart.com/?ref=localhost">Octopart </a>because of its powerful search engine for parts.</p><h2 id="researching-parts">Researching Parts</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making a BOM to Get LunchTrak Tags Ready for Manufacturing" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="983" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/image-1.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/image-1.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Octopart</figcaption></figure><p>For example, if I wanted to find a resistor component with a specific resistance, I would go to Passive Components --&gt; Resistors --&gt; Chip SMD Resistors and then filter out the right footprint and resistance values.

The only sad thing, though, is that the ATM2 Module I am using is not listed by any major parts distributor. PCBWay, which is the manufacturer that I will most likely use, does support user-submitted parts, but it is kinda annoying to have to do that in the first place. Oh well, I guess we&apos;ll see how that goes.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost Cards Work On Editor, But Not Preview]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stupid bug...]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/ghost-cards-work-on-editor-but-not-preview/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64227697689eb75618ecd9d5</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 05:19:20 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/cards_hu530bde54718f2b313fb590dbef31cd87_116580_932x0_resize_q100_h2_box_3.webp" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/cards_hu530bde54718f2b313fb590dbef31cd87_116580_932x0_resize_q100_h2_box_3.webp" alt="Ghost Cards Work On Editor, But Not Preview"><p>There is a bug in hosting Ghost locally on a Windows computer, where your cards work in the editor, but not preview: </p><p>See how the &quot;test &quot;header works here (editor)?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Ghost Cards Work On Editor, But Not Preview" loading="lazy" width="1702" height="885" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-14.png 1702w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Editor</figcaption></figure><hr><p></p><p>But in the preview, it does not work.

I finally learned how to use Fusion 360.</p><p>For a couple of months now, I&apos;ve been way too lazy to learn new complex software for my LunchTrak project, causing me to use online tools like EasyEDA (for PCB design) and TinkerCAD (for 3d printing). Yes, I still use EasyEDA because my schematics are so simple and because their platform gives me free coupons, but it may be beneficial in the future to learn something like KiCAD. Well today, I finally broke out of my shell and took on Fusion360. If you&apos;d like, here&apos;s my old case with TinkerCAD.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="1017" height="621" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-6.png 1017w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The lid doesn&apos;t work, and it&apos;s a pain changing things</figcaption></figure><p>I then started to open Fusion360. I&apos;m not gonna lie, I did not want to watch a 60-minute tutorial on how to use it, so I just messed around and clicked things until I got things to look how I wanted them to. For the first hour, I didn&apos;t even realize you could change the dimensions of sketches and boxes, so I had to delete and restart the entire model when I made a mistake. Another thing that was kind of trippy was the orthographic view. Having done a lot of development with Unity and Blender, it is incredibly mind-twisting to see the models from such a weird angle (edit: as I took the picture below, I accidentally figured out how to change it to perspective mode, which is what I&apos;m used to). I ended up just using the box at the top right to get the right view that I wanted.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="565" height="328"><figcaption>The box thing is really nice</figcaption></figure><p>For my new lid design, I decided to copy off of the case that Dave gave me, which has a little sliding thing.
