No more being lazy, no more being scared to take calls, no more avoiding people. Today, after my college counselor meeting with Ms. Ross, I called up Eric from Vypin. He suggested that we partner and use his prebuilt Bluetooth solution.

To be fully honest, I wanted to weasel my way out of it by saying something like &quot;Oh, I&apos;m taking a break&quot; or something similar, but they were persistent. When I told them that Bluetooth may not be the best solution, they suggested UWB and then asked whether we could talk over the phone. Coming off of my really nervous interview about Mr. Paley, I was scared, but I agreed. 10 minutes later I was on a call with Mark and Yuri.</p><h2 id="the-call">The Call</h2><p>Having pitched LunchTrak probably a hundred times already, explaining the gist of it was pretty easy, so I felt prepared. I then explained why Bluetooth wasn&apos;t the best solution because there&apos;s variation in signal strength and it isn&apos;t good when in a backpack. They responded by saying that their clients used Atmosic chips for asset tracking and it was perfectly fine, but agreed that having it in the backpack was tricky.</p><p>Both people were really nice and were willing to help brainstorm some ideas to solve my issues. I&apos;m actually really excited to get back into LunchTrak, and it&apos;s refreshing to know I&apos;m being productive again. Part of me wants to write about it in my college essay, but this is not why I&apos;m doing it. I am kinda nervous about college apps though. Regardless, there is a hard deadline soon because I will be graduating and will therefore not be physically present to debug and work with PAUSD (unless of course...)</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>Am I going back in? I hope so, and I hope that I can think about expanding the product to other use cases, not just the lunch line. Also, having it be a mobile app would make life a lot easier for the students, which might be an important requirement.</p><p>Dylan, please tell me that you didn&apos;t waste your senior year. This is your last year where you can start a &quot;business&quot; and everyone will support you because you are young. Also have fun and enjoy it. Isn&apos;t it crazy?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I spent 10 hours on the perfect Common App intro]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Wanna see me slowly lose my mind over 10 hours of writing?

It&#x2019;s with that same energy that I can explain anything I build, and it&#x2019;s the same enthusiasm that we&#x2019;ll pitch to our judges. In that moment, I&#x2019;m not just a programmer; I&#x2019;m a passionate storyteller about to win some awesome hackathon prizes.<br></p><p>Before my cousin left for China, I made a rap with him. Making raps with other people is one of the most fulfilling things I can do with someone else, and I hope to bring that with me when I go to college.<br></p><p>I rap all sorts of things about the AI video streaming technology we&#x2019;ve just developed, but I don&#x2019;t care anymore; I&#x2019;m in the zone and everyone around me is excited. <br></p><p>John doesn&#x2019;t seem to notice as I rap all sorts of things about the project we just built, but I don&#x2019;t really care anymore. My other teammates <br></p><p>As I proceed to blast the beat and spit some bars, John doesn&#x2019;t seem fazed, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter. I think I just created the ultimate product pitch to present to our judges, one that will capture the judges attention.<br></p><p>I go get my speaker, find a beat on Youtube, and blast it&#x2014;I think it&#x2019;s time we shake things up with a freestyle session.</p><p>Not only do I successfully wake John in time to finish our coding, I also come up with the craziest way to pitch our AI video streaming platform: <br></p><p>My goal is to not only wake up John in time to polish the code, but to also have some fun crafting a unique product pitch that will grab the judges attention. <br></p><p>But I don&#x2019;t just rap to wake John in time for our presentation, I do it for the chance to create a unique product pitch to show the judges. When we present our project a few hours later, I brought that same energy and passion that I have when I explain anything I build. In that moment, I remember to be more than just a programmer; I&#x2019;m a storyteller, and I have the most unique product pitch to win the hackathon.<br></p><p>that I&#x2019;m more than just a programmer; I&#x2019;m a storyteller, and I&#x2019;m ready to win the hackathon.<br></p><p>I do it to discover new, exciting ways that we can pitch our product to the judges, exploiting rhyme and rhythm to make it stick.

In that moment, I&#x2019;m not just a programmer; I&#x2019;m a storyteller ready to win the judges over.<br></p><p>I speak loudly enough for John to hear as I rap about the product we&#x2019;ve just developed together, finding new ways to rhyme about our inspiration, technology, and impact that we would need to present to the judges. <br></p><p>My raps always have a purpose, and this one was to tell the story of the product that we&#x2019;ve spent the last 12 hours developing. <br></p><p>In my rap, I discuss the best details about our AI streaming platform that we&#x2019;ve developed, and my teammates all look up with awe.

The room is suddenly filled with excitement as my friends watch my product pitch rap. It&#x2019;s with this same energy and confidence that I can explain anything I create, whether to a judge, investor, or even a friend.

A couple of days into the book, I was finally able to bring myself to lift at the gym every single day, and I still do it. Here&apos;s how this book can do the same for you.</p><h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2><p>Habits are incredibly powerful, and they determine who you are as a person. Getting 1% better every day will make you 37x better in a year. Sometimes, however, it is hard to get into a good habit or get rid of a bad one. The problem is not that you don&apos;t want to change, it&apos;s that you don&apos;t have the right system. There are 4 different &quot;laws&quot; to help you fix that.</p><h2 id="the-1st-law-make-it-obvious">The 1st Law: Make It Obvious</h2><p>If you want to go to the gym, prepare your gym bag and put it where you will always see it. By making the habit &quot;obvious&quot;, you are less likely to forget it. Moreover, it is easier to form new habits in new environments, since you are not fighting against old cues.</p><p>On the flip side, made bad habits invisible. If you play too much video games, maybe put the controller under your desk where you can&apos;t see it. This way, you will not be reminded about it all the time.</p><h3 id="habit-stacking">Habit Stacking</h3><p>This is a technique to make new habits obvious. The formula is &quot;After I [current habit], I will [new habit]&quot;. Basically, you will perform your new habit before or after something you already do, like eating breakfast or brushing your teeth.</p><h2 id="the-2nd-law-make-it-attractive">The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive</h2><p>The anticipation of a reward drives us to action, and greater anticipation leads to more dopamine in the brain. Make your &quot;hard&quot; habits attractive by bundling things you <em>need</em> to do with things you <em>want </em>to do. For me, I need to do more push-ups, so I do as many push-ups as I can before I allow myself to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (I do push-ups way too many times a day).</p><p>The inversion of this law is to make bad habits <em>unattractive</em>. One way is to highlight the benefits of avoiding the bad habit.</p><h3 id="use-other-people-to-shape-your-habits">Use Other People to Shape Your Habits</h3><p>We humans tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (friends and family), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). The easiest way to build better habits is to join groups or cultures where your desired habit is the norm. For example, my closest friends started going to the gym every day. Now, I go to the gym every day.</p><h2 id="the-3rd-law-make-it-easy">The 3rd Law: Make it Easy</h2><blockquote>&quot;Make it easy&quot; - Nathan Levy</blockquote><p>Stop planning and trying to be perfect. You learn more from taking action, which brings results and habits. You don&apos;t get fit by talking to your personal trainer; you do it by working out.</p><p>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is far less important than the number of times you actually do it. It doesn&apos;t matter if you exercise once a week for a year; doing five times a week for two months will probably form the habit better.</p><h3 id="the-law-of-least-effort">The Law of Least Effort</h3><p>Similar to &quot;make it obvious&quot;, we are more likely to perform our habits if it is easy and frictionless (we tend to gravitate towards the option that requires the least amount of work). Prime your environment to put your gym bag at the front door, putting your book at the dinner table, putting healthy snacks in the fridge, or anything that would make your good habit easier. On the other hand, make bad habits really hard to do. If you unplug your TV and put it in the garage, you probably will think twice before mindlessly binge-watching Netflix.</p><h3 id="two-minute-rule">Two Minute Rule</h3><p>Start small, and build up slowly. No new habit should take more than two minutes to perform. I used to be scared of going to the gym because of how many other people were there. On the first three days, I decided to drive over, do 3 sets, and then drive back home; it was incredibly short, but that made me willing to go through with it.</p><p>Standardize before you optimize. You can&apos;t improve a habit that doesn&apos;t exist.</p><h3 id="automation">Automation</h3><p>Automate your habits so that you don&apos;t need to think about performing good ones and avoiding bad ones. For example, you could set a screen time limit on your phone if you use too much social media. Or, you could use a meal delivery service to ensure you cook healthy foods. Technology is the best way to automate your habits.</p><p>Invest in one-time actions that lock in good habits. I bought a 3D printer so that I would continue creating and developing cool projects. A better example from the book is to enroll in an automatic savings plan.</p><h2 id="the-4th-law-make-it-satisfying">The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying</h2><p>Our bad habits often have immediate gratification, but lead to long-term unhappiness. Good habits are the opposite, which is why our brains sometimes want to avoid them. The secret to getting a habit to stick is to feel successful after performing a habit, even if it&apos;s just a little bit (maybe use an app to track your progress). The rule is: <em>What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</em></p><h3 id="habit-tracking">Habit Tracking</h3><p>Tracking your habits makes them obvious, attractive, and satisfying. You can use habit stacking to make sure you track your habits: &quot;After I [habit], I will [track my habit]&quot;. You don&apos;t, however, need to track everything. Some metrics are vanity metrics and do not help you find results. Wait you don&apos;t know what <em>vanity metrics</em> are? Read my post on <a href="https://blog.dylanlu.com/the-lean-startup/?ref=localhost">The Lean Startup</a>.</p><p>Important: Never miss a good habit twice. Get back on track as soon as possible to keep your streak alive.</p><h3 id="accountability-partner">Accountability Partner</h3><p>Create a <em>habit contract</em> with a partner to keep you both accountable. This is just a verbal or written commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don&apos;t follow through. The best way to make a bad habit unsatisfying is to immediately painful at the moment.</p><p>You can even automate this process. Maybe if you don&apos;t wake up at 6:30 AM to run, your phone will automatically post on Instagram that says &quot;I&apos;m too lazy to wake up early and I will pay $5 to the first person who DMs me&quot;.</p><h2 id="advanced-tactics">Advanced Tactics</h2><h3 id="pick-the-right-habit">Pick the Right Habit</h3><p>Genes influence your personality and behavior, so you have a natural advantage/disadvantage in some areas. It is a lot easier to stick with a habit that matches your personality, so pick the ones that work for you.</p><p>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. If you have a natural talent for a particular area, you will likely find progress fun and easy. But if you pick the wrong habit, it&apos;s really hard to succeed.</p><p> Here are some questions to find your habit:</p><ul><li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</li><li>What makes me lose track of time?</li><li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</li><li>What comes naturally to me?</li></ul><p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us <em>what </em>to work hard on.</p><h3 id="stay-motivated">Stay Motivated</h3><p>Use the <em>Goldilocks Rule</em> to stay motivated. The rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. Hit flow state to become fully immersed in an activity.</p><p>Habits will eventually become boring and you will want to quit&#x2014;even if you are making good progress. The only way to become excellent is to fall in love with boredom; you must be fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. Anyone can work hard when they are motivated, but going when the work isn&apos;t exciting is what makes the difference.</p><h3 id="the-downside-of-good-habits">The Downside of Good Habits</h3><p>Once you practice enough, a habit becomes automatic. This dynamic can prevent you from thinking about how to get even better. The moment you feel like you mastered an activity is when you are at risk of complacency. You need deliberate practice on top of automatic habits to achieve the next level of mastery</p><p>In order to be conscious of your performance over time, you should reflect and review a couple of times a year. Doing so will prevent the gradual slide of your abilities over time.</p><p>Building habits early on can help you build your desired identity, but your new beliefs can also hold you back from the next level of growth. Keep your identity small and do not cling too tightly to a single identity. If your identity is &quot;star Varsity player&quot;, what happens after you graduate high school? Keep your identity flexible.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-71323">Final Remarks (7/13/23)</h2><p>I liked this book a lot because of how easy and effective it was to change my habits. Rereading parts of the book for this post reminded me of some key details that helped me continue to code every day even though it was getting a little boring. My improvement will compound as I continue to exercise my habits, and I know I will be a lot better in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[LunchTrak Summer Pilot]]></title><description><![CDATA[The culmination of all the hard work I put into LunchTrak.

Funnily, I called Ms. Catalano by her first name in my email (I do that for my &quot;business&quot; emails) and she got really pissed at me.

I feel good enough to take a break and go to the gym.</p><p>It&apos;s 5:20 PM and I drive over to Atmosic. When I arrive, Ray is one of the only people in the lab. He seems to be really focused on something important. When I get there I see Tony leave and say bye to him; I think he was surprised to see me. Ray gives me a Joulescope and tells me to measure the current on my boards. Luckily, I have VBATT and GND test points on my board, so I soldered some copper wire to them and hooked up the Joulescope. As we analyzed the current, we noticed that the broken boards were not showing the beaconing pattern. We played around with BLE_adv settings and still could not find a beacon. We also pulled up a spectrum analyzer to confirm this. </p><p>We go to Ray&apos;s workspace and I hand him a broken board, my original prototype board, and an ATM2 module. He checks the schematics and probes around. When he goes to the solder station, he thinks that he shorted RFIO to GND. More testing showed that he didn&apos;t. That&apos;s when he realized the problem. There is supposed to be a DC block that will prevent current from leaking into the chip. There is supposed to be 3 megaohms resistance across RFIO to GND, but the broken boards show much less (around 300 ohms). This finding confirmed his suspicion that the boards had ESD damage, and he explained to me why ESD damage occurs. From my understanding, DC blocks (as the name suggests) do not allow DC to flow through (I think it is a capacitor). When you accidentally touch the pin, however, you might cause a sudden voltage drop or rise, meaning that there will be AC for a short amount of time. This causes the current to flow through the DC block and reach the chip, causing unrepairable damage.</p><p>As you can imagine, I was heartbroken. I didn&apos;t really know what to say to Ray except &quot;Thank you for helping me&quot;. For 10 minutes, I sat in my car holding back my tears. I called my Dad and told him what had happened. I was lightheaded on my drive back home and I couldn&apos;t think straight. The pilot was tomorrow, what would I say to them?</p><p>As I got home, my parents looked at me and knew what had happened. I didn&apos;t say anything and went into my room. When I came out, I took a quick shower and ate dinner. I explained to my parents what had just happened.</p><p>I&apos;m not going into the details of what happened next, but I think you (who is probably future me) already know what I was thinking and what I said to my Mom, and then to my Dad.</p><p>It was about 9 PM when I realized that not all the boards were damaged. I spent an hour testing all of the boards and found that 26 had functional RFIO. Of those boards, only 15 had functional WURX. I was happy to have had enough to actually run a quick test with my own Living Skills class. Still, I felt the lingering effects of what I had thought to be the end of my project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-13.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Graveyard of Broken Tags</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-12.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-12.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-12.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Working tags!</figcaption></figure><p>I went to sleep a little more optimistic about the pilot that would happen tomorrow.</p><h2 id="launch-day">Launch Day</h2><p>This is the big day, the day I&apos;ve waited 6 months for. I woke up naturally at 7 AM and immediately ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, and then ran some quick, last-minute tests with the system; it was all ready. I drove over to Gunn and went to the cafeteria. When I got there, I said hi to the lunch workers and set up my LunchTrak system on their computer. They didn&apos;t have any AC adapters, so I had to go to the tech office to ask for some. Syed drove me around campus in his golf cart and I actually got to see the server room in Gunn; he found a couple of old AC adapters and USB extenders there. I set the system up and went to class.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-14.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-15.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-15.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-15.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-15.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I think the teacher forgot about my thing (even though I reminded her at the beginning of class) because I didn&apos;t get to talk to the class about the project until 20 minutes before brunch. When I did, I gave a whole speech like &quot;Who here hates long lunch lines? I&apos;m working on a project to fix that&quot; blah blah. The students were initially confused but were willing to test it out. I handed the tags to most of the class (though some were the &quot;no wurx&quot; tags) and I helped them go through the pairing process. 5 minutes before lunch, everyone was set up, and I left class early to set up my camera in the lunch lines.</p><h3 id="brunch-time">Brunch Time</h3><p>Now the interesting part. I will show the video here before I talk about it (the real thing starts around 2:00).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>I can&apos;t stand rewatching it for more than 10 seconds; it was a disaster. The biggest issue on my end is that my scanner would scan students in immediately as they entered the room, meaning that the lunch worker wouldn&apos;t see their names pop up as they left the room. This problem is hard to fix due to the unstable nature of RSSI and Bluetooth. The next problem that you might have seen is that numbers would combine into something like 95000000950000001 when someone is typing their number and a LunchTrak test is right behind them. This is a software issue on their end, but it is still something I have to consider when developing a new solution.</p><h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3><p>I was very disappointed but also surprisingly relieved that the pilot was over; all of my worries and stress just disappeared. I knew that I would need to update everyone who helped me with the project, so I tried thinking of ways to phrase how the pilot went. Here&apos;s the email I sent out.</p><hr><p>Hi All,</p><p>Just wanted to give you a quick update on my LunchTrak testing yesterday during summer school.</p><p>Due to a problem during manufacturing, many of the tags were damaged and only 26 of the 75 tags worked properly. I was at least able to hand the working ones out to my Living Skills class. Because there weren&apos;t that many tags, we ended up mixing the lines with both LunchTrak testers and students who typed their IDs. The problem is that when a student types their number into the software, there is a short delay before the software registers that number. If a student with LunchTrak is right behind, the two numbers might be combined, leading to something like 9500000195000002. We had to ask the students to retype their numbers. Another problem is that a couple of students were mistakenly picked up by my scanner upon entering the room, causing confusion when they tried to exit because their names would not show up again. I am still looking into why this problem occurred and how I can prevent it.</p><p>Though the pilot did not go exactly as I planned, there are some positive takeaways. The students who were scanned in correctly had no delay and enjoyed the convenience of not needing to enter their ID. At the very least, this experiment helped confirm the idea that skipping the keypads leads to time and convenience benefits. I just need to focus on ensuring the above issues do not happen.</p><p>Overall, I will be brainstorming and tinkering with potential fixes to solve the issues mentioned above. Thank you all for your help with my project. I will keep you updated on my progress.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Dylan</p><hr><p>So yeah, admit your faults early and then focus on the positives! (see my post on the book <a href="https://blog.dylanlu.com/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/?ref=localhost">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>)</p><h2 id="conclusion-lessons-and-whats-next">Conclusion, Lessons, and What&apos;s Next</h2><p>I spent 6 months building a product that didn&apos;t work. But it wasn&apos;t wasted: the students who were successfully scanned in loved the product and its speed + convenience factor). My &quot;<a href="https://blog.dylanlu.com/the-lean-startup/?ref=localhost">Lean Startup</a>&quot; Spidey-sense tells me that I had just confirmed my value hypothesis, but I will need to pivot on the underlying technology. If I had read the book earlier, I would know that 6 months is a wayyy too long turnaround time to run an experiment like this. I should have at least tested it with my friends earlier on.</p><p>Seeing the results of this experiment could easily make me depressed if I don&apos;t try seeing it from the positive side. For a first product, being able to demo it to PAUSD administrators, get them to pay for it, actually go through the manufacturing process, and have everything on time for a pilot is actually very encouraging news. I have the ability to get my ideas and products out there, I just need to focus on getting it to work next time (this should come easier as I learn more and get better). The fact that I have my own LLC should make me happy enough. I can give it a new name (maybe LuWang LLC, or probably something else) and make LunchTrak a DBA. Then I can make all my small businesses a DBA to my parent LLC. Dude, I have a business bank account and credit card. Why should I be upset?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure exactly what the future looks like for LunchTrak, but I do not intend on giving up right away. I will, however, take a small break from it to explore some other projects like my 3D Printed Guardian Sword, Gunn Alumni (complete pivot), and Gunn Elimination. I have a lot of cool things to work on this summer and I look forward to all of them. Okay, maybe not so much on my college essays.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Lean Startup]]></title><description><![CDATA[Notes on Eric Ries' The Lean Startup.

Jon Paris (from my small group) also vouched for the book, so I became really interested in reading it. The book is mostly about how to run a successful startup and prevent failure by following a quick, effective process. The five basic principles are:</p><ol><li>Entrepreneurs are everywhere</li><li>Entrepreneurship is management</li><li>Use <em>validated learning</em></li><li>Use <em>innovation accounting</em></li><li>Use <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> feedback loop</li></ol><h2 id="vision">Vision</h2><p>Many startups fail, but success can be engineered when following the right process. What Eric Ries proposes generally goes against what most of think about companies. For example, he defines entrepreneurship as a form of management, despite their opposite connotations (entrepreneurs hate management!).</p><h3 id="start">Start</h3><p>Use <em>learning milestones </em>to track progress rather than focusing on metrics that, while seemingly indicate progress, are not a sustainable measure to evaluate how the company is really doing.</p><p>Startups should focus on building the right thing (what customers will want and pay for) as quickly as possible. Instead of making a complex plan and following it for months, use the <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> feedback loop to get results faster. As the name suggests, you want to quickly create/modify a product, run an experiment to see how customers react, and use the findings to make better improvements.</p><p>Your <em>vision </em>is the fundamental change you want to see in the world. Your <em>strategy</em> is how you will accomplish this goal, and includes the business model, product road map, assumptions on who customers are, and more. Your <em>product</em> is the result of the strategy and will constantly evolve as you optimize.</p><h3 id="define">Define</h3><p>Startup: a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty</p><p>Innovation: though unpredictable, it can still be managed</p><p>Leadership: creating conditions that enable employees to do the kinds of experimentation that entrepreneurship requires</p><h3 id="learn">Learn</h3><p>Customers do not know what they want in a product; asking them is therefore useless. Instead, figure out what they want by their actions or inactions (study how they interact with the product, usually by getting volunteers and conducting in-person tests). Any action that does not contribute to learning about what creates value to customers is a waste.</p><p>It&apos;s possible to build most products. The more important question, however, is &quot;Should the product be built?&quot; and &quot;Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?&quot;</p><h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3><p>Do not &quot;Just do it&quot; when it comes to launching a product. If you fail, you won&apos;t get the validated learning necessary to adapt your product. Instead, test a small idea to answer big questions (Zappos wanted to test the assumption that there was a demand for buying shoes online, so they took pictures of another store&apos;s shoes and sold them on their website).</p><p>Find <em>early adopters</em>, which are customers who most eagerly want the product. They tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and will be willing to give feedback. </p><p>Success is about learning to solve customer&apos;s problems, not just delivering new features.</p><p>An experiment is more than just a theoretical inquiry; it is also a first product. If any experiment is successful, managers can start enlisting early adopters and hiring employees.</p><p><strong>Important Assumptions Every Startup Makes</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Value Hypothesis:</strong> Does the product actually bring value to customers? Use experiments, not surveys, to prove it.</li><li><strong>Growth Hypothesis:</strong> How will new customers discover the product? </li></ol><p><strong>Questions For Product Development</strong></p><ol><li>Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?</li><li>If there was a solution, would they buy it?</li><li>Would they buy it from us?</li><li>Can we build a solution for that problem?</li></ol><h2 id="steer">Steer</h2><p>The products that a startup builds are actually experiments; learning how to build a sustainable business is the outcome. Use an MVP to experiment and test your most important assumptions (value and growth hypothesis). The MVP is the version of the product that allows the quickest cycle of the <em>Build-Measure-Learn </em>feedback loop while also expending the least effort. Even if you are on time and on budget, it doesn&apos;t matter if you build something no one wants.</p><p>For example, Facebook validated their value hypothesis after realizing that half of their users used the site everyday. It is clear that the product is valuable to customers.</p><h3 id="leap">Leap</h3><p>Use a strategy to figure out the right questions to ask. A startup&apos;s early efforts should be focused on testing the right assumptions as quickly as possible.</p><p>Successful entrepreneurs discover which parts of their plans are working and which aren&apos;t. Being &quot;at the right time and place&quot; is not enough.</p><h3 id="test">Test</h3><p>First products are not meant to be perfect. In fact, early adopters can be suspicious when a product is too polished. Therefore, adding additional features beyond what is needed for the experiments is wasteful, especially when it slows down the experiments. Depending on what industry you&apos;re in, the MVP can be super complicated (like a working prototype) or as simple as an ad. Focus on what assumptions you need to test and how you&apos;ll test them.</p><p>If you don&apos;t know who the customer is, you don&apos;t know what quality is. Ask them what features in the design they care about, as it may differ from what you think matters most.</p><p>The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else. Remove features from the MVP that do not contribute directly to the learning you seek, and start the process of validated learning as soon as possible.</p><h3 id="types-of-mvps">Types of MVPs</h3><ul><li>Video MVP: Explain the concept and ask people to sign up.</li><li>Concierge MVP: Do everything yourself to create an awesome, personalized experience. For example, a grocery delivery app might have the CEO personally delivering it to a customer to make the experience the best for the customer.</li><li>Wizard of Oz MVP: Simulate the technology you would need to develop by doing it yourself behind the scenes.</li></ul><h3 id="measure">Measure</h3><p>How do you know if you are making the product better? A good design is one that will change customer behavior for the better. To measure, you need a clear baseline metric, a hypothesis about what will improve that metric, and a set of experiments to test that hypothesis. Split testing is a good way to test different versions of a product, letting you know what matters to them and what does not.</p><p>Progress is measured by evidence that a sustainable business can be built around the product or service. Measure your productivity according to validated learning, not in terms of adding new features.</p><p><strong>The 3 A&apos;s of Metrics</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Clear cause and effect between experiment and metric</li><li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Make the reports as simple as possible so everyone understands them</li><li><strong>Auditable: </strong>You must be able to test the data by hand</li></ol><h3 id="innovation-accounting">Innovation Accounting</h3><p>Jon Paris told me that this is the most important part of the book. Innovation accounting is a way for startups to objectively prove they are learning how to grow a sustainable business. By getting rid of vanity metrics (misleading metrics that seem to suggest growth) and replacing them with learning milestones, can be kept accountable for their decisions.</p><p>First, establish an MVP to get real data on where the company is right now. Next, tune the engine &quot;towards the ideal&quot; by making all the optimizations and changes possible. When the possibilities are exhausted, the company must make a decision: pivot or preserve.</p><h3 id="pivot-or-preserve">Pivot Or Preserve</h3><p>The true measure of a runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy. When entrepreneurs have unclear hypotheses, it&apos;s almost impossible to experience complete failure, which is a necessary force to promote radical change and pivots.</p><p>Start now because you will never learn what needs to change without launching. Be careful though, since low-quality MVPs only work for early adopters; mainstream customers have higher demands for their products.</p><p>A pivot is a new strategic hypothesis that will require a new MVP to test. Optimization, tuning, and iteration are all methods to test a clear hypothesis in the service of the company&apos;s vision.</p><h3 id="types-of-pivots">Types of Pivots</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>Zoom-in:</strong></strong> A single feature becomes the whole product.</li><li><strong><strong>Zoom-out:</strong></strong> What was considered the whole product becomes a feature of something much larger.</li><li><strong><strong>Customer segment:</strong></strong> We have built a product that solves a real problem for real customers, but they are not the customers we originally planned to serve.</li><li><strong><strong>Customer need: </strong></strong>The problem we were trying to solve turns out to not be very important. However, we discover related problems that are important in the process.</li><li><strong><strong>Platform:</strong></strong> Change from an application to a platform or vice versa</li><li><strong><strong>Business architecture:</strong></strong> High margin, low volume versus low margin, high volume. Or B2B versus B2C.</li><li><strong><strong>Value capture:</strong></strong> How you decide to make money.</li><li><strong><strong>Engine of growth:</strong></strong> Change in strategy to seek faster, more profitable growth.</li><li><strong><strong>Channel:</strong></strong> Change your distribution channel.</li><li><strong><strong>Technology:</strong></strong> Achieve the same solution with a different technology.</li></ul><h2 id="accelerate">Accelerate</h2><h3 id="batch">Batch</h3><p>Testing in smaller batches leads to faster learning. The ability to learn faster from customers is an essential competitive advantage because it means you can roll out new features and validate them quicker. For example, I could quickly manufacture 100 products and learn from it even though I would get a much better price per for 1000 of them.</p><h3 id="grow">Grow</h3><p>Your engine of growth is how startups achieve sustainable growth, which is when you get new customers coming in as the result of the actions of past customers. Measuring performance in the following engines of growth give good indicators on how well the startup is doing.</p><p><strong>3 Engines of Growth</strong></p><ol><li>Sticky Engine: The rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the <em>churn rate </em>(percent of users who stopped using the product)</li><li>Viral Engine: The <em>viral coefficient</em> (how many more users join for each new member) is above 1</li><li>Paid Engine: The customer lifetime value outweigh the cost of advertisement</li></ol><h3 id="adapt">Adapt</h3><p>Training your team to think &quot;lean&quot; is difficult, though important. Most mistakes are caused by flawed systems, not bad people. Always try to figure out how to prevent those situations in the future. To understand the root causes of failure, use the &quot;Five Whys&quot;</p><p><strong>The Five Whys</strong></p><ol><li>Use it for every major problem</li><li>Setup a meeting with everyone involved, or who is affected by the problem</li><li>Ask &quot;why did the problem happen?&quot; and then ask why to each subsequent answer until you have reached the solution</li></ol><p>Example: </p><p>Why did the website go down? The server crashed</p><p>Why did the server crash? The free tier expired on AWS</p><p>Why were we not notified about nearing the usage limits? We were, but the email was sent to an old company account.</p><p>Why was it sent to the old company account? We did not update our company information</p><p>Why did we not update our company information? Don&apos;t know. Maybe we should update the company information.</p><h3 id="innovate">Innovate</h3><p>Do not make the mistake of splitting off teams into parts like &quot;frontend&quot;, &quot;design&quot;, &quot;communications&quot;. Oftentimes, your employees will need to be involved in multiple sections of the company to get their work done. Therefore, you want teams that are cross-functional, removing the need for your employees to go through ten different people to answer questions.</p><p><strong>3 Structural Attributes For a Startup</strong></p><ol><li>Scarce but secure resources</li><li>Independent authority to develop the business</li><li>Personal stake in the company&apos;s outcome</li></ol><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><p>Waste comes from working on the wrong things, not doing them inefficiently. Working on something useless at high speeds is completely wasteful, so don&apos;t do it.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-61323">Final Remarks (6/13/23)</h2><p>I spit-balled a lot of vocab words, but what do they really mean? I really suggest picking up the book and reading it through; it will clarify a lot of the concepts that I summarized in this post.</p><p>This book was probably the most enjoyable and immediately applicable for me. I read this book about 3 months ago, before I had any idea what I would be doing with LunchTrak over the summer. Exposure to these ideas helps me clearly see what strategies I can be using to achieve validated learning, which is the most important idea I took away from the book (Jon Paris said innovation accounting and he is pretty successful). I like this idea mainly because it makes startups seem so much more simple: all they need to focus on is learning how customers react to their product and how they can get more products.</p><p>This was a pretty long post, but I&apos;ll update it in the future if I remember any important ideas that I missed.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Common App Idea: The Legend of Zelda]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It&apos;s that time guys.

The summer before senior year in high school is going to be full of college essay grinding. On top of my LunchTrak project, Gunn Alumni, and Elimination (blog post soon!), I will probably be dedicating several hours each week to writing my essays. Right now the plan is to get an hour of writing every day from 9 pm - 10 pm; no excuses.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s no fun spending several hours writing about boring things, so I&apos;m gonna write about things I&apos;m actually interested in. For example, I&apos;m playing around with writing about The Legend of Zelda in my Common App essay.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/zelda-wallpapers-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Common App Idea: The Legend of Zelda" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/zelda-wallpapers-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/zelda-wallpapers-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/zelda-wallpapers-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/zelda-wallpapers-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Zelda Image</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-essay">The Essay</h2><p>I&apos;m kinda lost on what to write about, so I looked online for some inspiration.

I will probably also need to pick some common themes to best show who I am.</p><h3 id="theme">Theme</h3><p>For my theme, I think I definitely want to highlight some of my achievements with coding. For the Common App essay, I could focus on the fact that playing Zelda sparked my passion for creating my own games, which in turn led me onto a path to do more coding. I built my first &quot;game&quot; on Khan Academy while I was in 3rd grade, and my first Unity game in 5th grade at a summer camp. After that, I taught myself web development, AI, and everything else that seemed interesting. Here&apos;s one way I was thinking of tying this story back to Zelda.</p><hr><p>Learning to code is an adventure. There are so many places to explore, puzzles to solve, and friends to meet along the way. In 3rd grade, I discovered Javascript and dove headfirst into the world of game development.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGxVWlDdunyh4hanrtN9zqIDTdI=/0x0:1920x1080/1200x800/filters:focal(359x524:665x830)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72273019/zelda_totk_great_sky_island.0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Common App Idea: The Legend of Zelda" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A Whole New World</figcaption></figure><p>With nothing more than an old laptop and a sense of curiosity, I started to look at this new world around me. There is so much to explore, where do I even start? The tutorial island taught me basic Javascript (and I was already comfortable writing basic logic), but now I&apos;m in the real world; that simply isn&apos;t enough to build real things. Walking around, I discovered Unity, which is a pretty powerful yet simple game engine. At this point, I ran into some problems.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/Bokoblin_pose.webp" class="kg-image" alt="Common App Idea: The Legend of Zelda" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Bokoblin_pose.webp 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Bokoblin_pose.webp 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/Bokoblin_pose.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oh no!</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out, coding is not so easy. I really struggled to learn Unity and it took me hours to wrap my head around basic concepts. Given that I was in a summer camp, my end result was pretty cool, but rather than understanding what I was doing, I was blindly copying the code in front of me. That didn&apos;t stop me though; one problem after another, I was slowly making progress. </p><p>Side Note: Ok I&apos;m reading this over again and I don&apos;t think I&apos;m gonna continue it. I think the parallels between Zelda to learning to code do exist, but it feels kind of forced and hard to explain. If I were to continue in this direction, I&apos;d do something like this:</p><ul><li>I die over and over again, but each time I am building more awareness of my enemies and how to conquer them</li><li>From each fallen enemy is a relic of my victory. Collecting these items gives me the toolset to build more complex things later on</li><li>I see an opportunity for a difficult boss and I dive right in. Using my experience from defeating smaller enemies, I can navigate parts of the fight easily. But when the enemy pulls out a new attack, I am left defenseless; again, I must die over and over again to build a new attack strategy</li><li>Once I have a couple of boss fights under my belt, I begin to feel more confident in my abilities. I venture far out into the world, completing puzzles and fighting monsters along the way. I can even share my knowledge with fellow travelers along the way, and they give back knowledge in return. Sometimes, we even take on boss fights together</li><li>Now that I have the toolset and experience to thrive in this environment, coding becomes a lot more fun and I enjoy spending hours and hours building with it</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Yeah... I&apos;m not liking this either. I had a whole other draft about another spin on this idea, but I ended up scraping it. Anyways, that was fun writing, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to continue in this direction. Thanks for reading.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunn Alumni - Progress Check Summer 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[A quick progress check on our Gunn Alumni website, and some potential issues to look out for in the future.]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/gunn-alumni-progress-check-summer-2023/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64817492853dec7a581bf932</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 07:17:32 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/Gunn_High_School_Apr_2020.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/Gunn_High_School_Apr_2020.jpg" alt="Gunn Alumni - Progress Check Summer 2023"><p>Hey, I just wanted to make a quick post on my Gunn Alumni project.

The problem, however, is that the Mailjet rate limited us at only 3 emails! Only 3 people were able to get verified through our system, and we had tons of questions come to us over email. The quick solution was to manually verify students in the database, and it took me a while to do that. I was on a call with some of the other leaders and we decided to remove the need to email verification for now; simply knowing your email is probably good enough (no one is trying to hack or impersonate anyone so it&apos;s fine). </p><p>As of now, we have 33 verified users, none of which have a bio or a profile picture. Yikes! That means we successfully delivered a product no one cares about. If we followed the Lean Startup&apos;s Build-Measure-Plan feedback loop method (more on that in a later Dylan&apos;s Book Notes post), we could have pivoted our product to become more interesting for users. But for now, we will just cry ourselves to sleep as our sweet baby is left abandoned by the graduating class of 2023.

Yes, I did it! I convinced the Food Services people to pilot LunchTrak over the summer. I think the <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> book helped since I listened more and let them think that some ideas were their own (even when I was already thinking it), like splitting two lines for &apos;express lane&apos; or piloting the program over the summer where there are fewer people&quot;</p><p>-- My notebook (3/22/23)</p><hr><p><em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> completely changed how I deal with other people. Combining some ideas from this book and the <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, my new approach to solving disputes and asking for favors was wildly more successful. For instance, I had a lot of success in my meetings for the LunchTrak project, which we are going to pilot over summer school. I never wrote any notes in my notebook, so I will summarize whatever I can remember here.</p><h3 id="a-persons-name-is-to-him-or-her-the-sweetest-and-most-important-sound-in-any-language">&quot;A person&apos;s name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language&quot;</h3><p>Make it a priority never to forget someone&apos;s name (especially if you think you&apos;ll ask them for a favor in the future). I remember some kid in my Analysis class was like, &quot;What&apos;s your name again?&quot;, and it was really annoying. The point is, DO NOT forget people&apos;s names.</p><p>Remembering peoples&apos; names makes them feel important, which is what all of us want at the end of the day (at least according to Dale Carnegie). Use this knowledge to your advantage and build better relationships with other people.</p><h3 id="how-to-get-what-you-want">How to Get What You Want</h3><p>Stop criticizing, arguing, or complaining; it&apos;s really annoying. Instead, you should be open to the other person&apos;s ideas and be genuinely interested in what they have to say. Related to this idea (but from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People</em>) is that you should always listen and understand the problem before you respond (Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood). If you want people to listen to you, you need to them to feel like you&apos;re listening to them first.</p><p>People are generally interested in what <em>they </em>want. If you want something, you have to show them how it will help them get what they want. For example, if I wanted the school to pilot my LunchTrak program, I would emphasize how it would make their lives easier because they don&apos;t have to futz around with barcode scanners and keypads. A quote from the book: &quot;Arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.&quot;</p><h3 id="get-people-to-like-you">Get People to Like You</h3><p>If you want people to be interested in you, be genuinely interested in the other person. Listen to how they are feeling and build a good relationship with them, instead of focusing on what you want. You also want to make the other person feel important, but you don&apos;t want to be insincere (this can be seen from a mile away). One way to do this is to &quot;be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise&quot; (quoted like a million times in the book). Overall, just be a genuine person and people will like you.</p><h3 id="other-tips-for-getting-people-to-agree-with-you">Other Tips For Getting People to Agree With You</h3><p>Be respectful to the other person. Never say &quot;you&apos;re stupid&quot; or &quot;you&apos;re wrong&quot;. What&apos;s the point of insulting someone who you want to agree with you? If you are wrong on anything, be quick to admit it and be empathetic (apologize). Try starting out as friendly as possible to build trust, and try truly seeing things from the other person&apos;s point of view. If you can&apos;t get someone to agree with your reasoning, try appealing to a nobler motive. An example from the book is when a famous person wanted to get his kid&apos;s pictures removed from a news article, he told the reporter that their mother is worried about their safety. It&apos;s hard to argue with a mother&apos;s desire to keep her kids safe.</p><h3 id="how-to-be-a-leader">How to Be a Leader</h3><p>Before you point out other people&apos;s mistakes, start with your own mistakes first. This will come out as less offensive and could prevent negative feelings. Speaking of mistakes, try to call them out indirectly when possible. For instance, you could ask someone how the company can ensure the server doesn&apos;t crash in the future instead of blaming them for crashing the server.</p><p>Another strategy to get people to listen is to give them a reputation to live up to. This idea is related to how people want to feel important; if you tell the company that John is the best web developer you&apos;ve ever met, he&apos;ll be motivated to show that he is the best. Similarly, you want people to be happy and excited doing the things that you want. It is really hard to motivate someone to do something they hate, so try spinning the task in a way that seems fun.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-6423">Final Remarks (6/4/23)</h2><p>I listened to this book in the car on the way to school every day for a couple of weeks, and I am glad I did so. Working well with other people and building relationships is one of the most important aspects of anyone&apos;s career regardless of what they want to do. Especially for me&#x2013;since I want to learn about entrepreneurship&#x2013;learning to work with people is a must. I hope to put these ideas into practice in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zero to One]]></title><description><![CDATA[Notes on Peter Thiel's Zero to One.

It allowed me to see how seemingly complex applications are actually composed from many simple concepts, and that the only way to build consistent applications is to have consistent concepts. Since finishing the book, I see software in an entirely different light. I&apos;d love to say that I&apos;ve implemented these ideas into my own apps (like Gunn Alumni), but I don&apos;t think this is true. In my next few projects (like Gunn Elimination, Launchpad, etc), I will try putting these ideas into practice.</p><p>Apart from having some creative insights on software, this book got me into the habit of reading everyday.

There are only two weeks before it starts and there is still a lot I need to get done. I&apos;ve been kinda stressed out lately with all my finals and LunchTrak stuff, and I really hope I can pull off this summer pilot.</p><hr><h2 id="wake-up-receiver">Wake Up Receiver</h2><p>First off, I&apos;ll give you (AKA future me) a quick rundown of what I&apos;ve accomplished since my last post. I figured out the wake-up receiver matching with Andy and tested it out with Dave. The range is really good for a 30dbm gain. I have a 20dbm RF amplifier which gives about 2.5 meters wake-up range, but it is not practical. I&apos;m currently waiting for my 30dbm amplifier to come on eBay.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image-3.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/image-3.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tag (center), Scanner (left), Amplifier (right)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="pcbway-assembly-order">PCBWay Assembly Order</h2><p>Well, this is a mess...</p><p>I placed my order for my PCB assembly almost a month ago, and there have been many problems and obstacles since. The major one that&apos;s been keeping me up at night is the miscommunication between PCBWay and Siqore which almost shut down my entire project; I was told that the ATM2 Modules could not be shipped to Taiwan. My first thought was that it was because of the US-China chip wars, and I became really depressed for 5 minutes. I then looked up what the trade restrictions were and found that they only apply to high-performance chips, a rule which does not apply in my situation. After sending multiple emails and calling PCBWay a couple of times (thank God my dad knows Chinese because the lady did not understand me at all), I think the issue has been resolved. The part should ship to China in the next 2 days, which is much faster than the 20-day timeline I originally thought it would be.</p><p>Another big problem (and good learning experience I guess) is that my GND pin on the battery holder was not connected to anything. This is a big problem, and I would not have caught this if PCBWay did not send an email asking whether to put solder paste on the center of the battery holder pad. See the image below. Notice how the circle is not green?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="780" height="414" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-4.png 780w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The $100 mistake</figcaption></figure><p>The previous drawing did not connect the pin to GND, even though it looks like it should.

Luckily, it didn&apos;t, and it only set me back $100. Imagine if the broken boards shipped and none of them worked...</p><h2 id="the-case">The Case</h2><p>This part is kinda fun.</p><p>Because we are not dealing with small 3D-printed batches anymore, the cost to print all 75 cases on JLCPCB is about $160. Crazy right? I&apos;m sure that&apos;s probably cheaper than elsewhere, but that brings my product up $2 per part more than it should be, and would also cause me to exceed my budget. Luckily PAUSD included tax when they mailed the check, so I got an extra $75 to compensate for some other costs I did not account for (like how PCBWay charged extra for supplying parts).</p><p>Instead of paying JLCPCB to print them for me, and then wait 2 weeks for them to ship, I decided to do something more fun: I&apos;d use the money that the school paid me to buy my own 3D printer, and then print the 75 cases with that. I ended up buying the Creality Ender S1 Pro, which is a great hobbyist printer that cost me $390 (on sale from $500). Yes, this is more than my budget, but I was able to split the cost after a kind investment from my sister. Basically, she would also be able to use the printer and she would be able to cash out 5% of my profits at any time she wants. Pretty good deal for me I would say, I got a 3D printer for free!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image-6.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Printing a Prototype Case</figcaption></figure><p>While it is cool to have my own 3D printer, there are some notable drawbacks. The print precision, for example, is much worse on my printer than on JLCPCB&apos;s printers. I think it is because they use resin, which gives smoother finishes. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-7.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image-7.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image-7.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/image-7.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Noticeable Quality Differences Between the Two</figcaption></figure><p>I am also working on a new case design, which will give rounded edges and better text quality.
