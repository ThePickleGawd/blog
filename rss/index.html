Sprints are all about working with your team to quickly go from planning to prototyping, to live user interactions, and using them can help speed up hard business decisions. You won&apos;t need a polished product, just something convincing enough for your tester (even an interactive Figma could work).</p><h2 id="when-and-why-sprint">When and Why Sprint?</h2><p>Use sprints when you need to answer an urgent question about your business, product, or customers. They can help you avoid things like waiting 6 months before realizing Bluetooth doesn&apos;t work (hmmm I wonder who did that...). Sprints are used in several companies and have led to incredibly cool products (like AirBnB).</p><p>Also, a sprint is requires 5 full days of undivided attention. If you can&apos;t form a team that can go through this process, it won&apos;t be as effective.</p><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><ul><li>Choose an important and urgent challenge</li><li>Assemble a diverse team of specialized people. Have 1-2 Deciders (leads)</li><li>Prepare supplies in advance (lots of Post-Its!) </li></ul><h2 id="monday-map">Monday: Map</h2><p>The first day will be spent crafting a clear question that you&apos;d like to address by the end of the sprint. But first, you&apos;ll need to understand your company&apos;s long-term goals. Start with a question like this: &quot;Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be six months, a year, or even five years from now?&quot;</p><h3 id="uncover-underlying-assumptions-morning">Uncover Underlying Assumptions (morning)</h3><p>When creating your goal, you were probably quite optimistic about the future. But there are dangerous assumptions that you took to get there. The next step is to turn each assumption into a question, which you will then be answering by the end of the sprint. Think about the following:</p><ul><li>What questions do we want to answer in this sprint?</li><li>To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true?</li><li>Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused this?</li></ul><h3 id="create-a-map">Create a Map</h3><p>The map will show your customers moving through every step of your service or product and will help you narrow your broad challenge into a specific goal later on. It also lays out how everything fits together, so it will be easier to structure your solutions sketches and prototypes later on.</p><p>On a giant white board, create your map:</p><ol><li><strong>List the actors</strong> (on the left). The &quot;actors&quot; are important characters in your story</li><li><strong>Write the ending </strong>(on the right). It&apos;s easier to figure this out than the middle steps</li><li><strong>Words and arrows in between</strong>. It&apos;s not art, keep it functional</li><li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>. There should be around 5 to 15 steps. Otherwise, it&apos;s too complicated</li><li><strong>Ask for help. </strong>Keep asking your team if the map makes sense</li></ol><h3 id="ask-the-experts-afternoon">Ask the Experts (afternoon)</h3><p>Get your team to individually interview people with specialized knowledge about your solution. Information is asymmetrically distributed across the company, and you&apos;ll need people who can pick up on easily missed details.</p><p>Here&apos;s who to talk to:</p><p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Talk with the &quot;Decider&quot; about questions like &quot;What will make this project a success&quot;, &quot;What&apos;s our unique advantage or opportunity&quot;, and &quot;What&apos;s the biggest risk&quot;</p><p><strong>Voice of the Customer: </strong>Find the person who knows the customer the best and can explain their perspective</p><p><strong>How Things Word:</strong> Who best understands the mechanics of your product? How does everything fit together?</p><p><strong>Previous Efforts: </strong>Sometimes, people already thought about a similar problem and may have some experience with attempting to solve them.</p><h3 id="how-might-we">How Might We</h3><p>While listening to the experts, note any interesting concepts and create a &quot;How Might We&quot; note on a Post-it. These are questions that could be interesting to solve, like &quot;HMW - Structure key info for screening patients?&quot;. Write in big markets so it forces you to be concise, and so that it can be seen easily.</p><ol><li>Write a &quot;How Might We&quot; on a Post-it by yourself</li><li>Stick it onto a wall when everyone is done</li><li>Vote silently with sticker &quot;dots&quot;. Each person gets two dots, while the Decider gets four dots.</li><li>Select the ones with multiple votes and use those targets to guide the rest of the sprint</li></ol><h3 id="pick-the-target">Pick the Target</h3><p>The final task for Monday is to choose the target for your sprint. Who is the most important customer, and what is the most critical experience for them? The &quot;How Might We&quot; notes can often make this decision obvious, but the Decider is always the one who gets the final say&#x2013;this is the biggest opportunity to do something great.</p><p>If the decider wants help, use a straw poll. Everyone should write their vote on a piece of paper, and after the votes are tallied, there should be a discussion on any big differences in opinion. The decider can now make their call.</p><p>Now that you have identified a long-term goal and question to answer, everyone will be ready for the next step: it&apos;s time to come up with some solutions.</p><h2 id="tuesday-sketch">Tuesday: Sketch</h2><p>Not gonna lie, I wrote everything above about 4 months ago, and I don&apos;t remember the book in as much depth.</p><p>The goal for this day is to generate a wide range of potential solutions. You start by reviewing what you did yesterday, and then each person will individually <em>sketch</em>, following a four-step process: notes, ideas, crazy 8s, and solution sketch.</p><ol><li><strong>Notes: </strong>Have the team walk around the room and take notes to refresh their memories before committing to a solution. Feel free to research specific details from the company&apos;s own product. This takes about twenty minutes, and then spend three minutes at the end reviewing everything.</li><li><strong>Ideas: </strong>Jot rough ideas, fill a sheet of paper with doodles, diagrams, stick figures, etc. Take twenty minutes with this and then review at the end for three minutes.</li><li><strong>Crazy 8s: </strong>Each person takes their strongest ideas and rapidly sketches eight variations in eight minutes. This promotes potential breakthroughs.</li><li><strong>Solution Sketch: </strong>Sketch a three-panel of the final solution to be looked at and judged by others. It&apos;s the final sketch!</li></ol><h2 id="wednesday-decide">Wednesday: Decide</h2><p>Today you&apos;ll evaluate ideas and decide on the solution that will be prototyped. There&apos;s a five-step process.</p><ol><li><strong>Art museum:</strong> Put the solution sketches on the wall with masking tape</li><li><strong>Heat map: </strong>Look at all the solutions in silence, and use dot stickers to mark interesting parts</li><li><strong>Speed critique: </strong>Quickly discuss the highlights of each solution, and use sticky notes to capture big ideas</li><li><strong>Straw poll: </strong>Each person chooses one solution, and votes for it with a dot sticker</li><li><strong>Supervote: </strong>The Decider makes the final decision, with more stickers!</li></ol><h2 id="thursday-prototype">Thursday: Prototype</h2><p>Now it&apos;s time to build a prototype that can be tested with real users. It&apos;s much more effective and easier to fake it rather than build the real thing. It&apos;ll emulate what your product will actually do, without needing the complex implementation and lack of polish.</p><p>Here&apos;s one way to do this.</p><ol><li><strong>Pick the right tools: </strong>Often, your usual tools are too slow. Use something like Apple&apos;s Keynote that can mimic what you want quickly. I&apos;d probably use Figma.</li><li><strong>Divide and conquer: </strong>Makers will create individual components, while Stitchers will put them together. Writers make the content reasonable (we <em>hate</em> lorem ipsum).</li><li><strong>Stich it together: </strong>Make sure fake content is consistent throughout the app</li><li><strong>Do a trial run: </strong>Do it around 3pm to give you enough time to fix it.</li></ol><h2 id="friday-test">Friday: Test</h2><p>Now it&apos;s time to learn from watching/interviewing users. There should generally be around five interviewees.</p><p>Here&apos;s how you should run them.</p><ol><li><strong>Friendly welcome: </strong>People need to feel comfortable to be honest and open, so start with something like &quot;Thanks for coming in today! Your feedback is really important to us&quot;</li><li><strong>Context questions:</strong> Ask about the customer&apos;s background so you get a better idea on who they are and how they&apos;d user your product</li><li><strong>Introduce the prototype:</strong> &quot;Would you like to see the prototype? I didn&apos;t design it so I won&apos;t be hurt by your feedback. Also think aloud!&quot;</li><li><strong>Tasks and nudges: </strong>&quot;What do you expect that will do? What is this for?&quot;. Just gauge their reactions.</li><li><strong>Quick debrief: </strong>&quot;How does this product compare to what you do now? What did you wish was different?&quot;</li></ol><p>In general, you should be watching these interviews together and taking notes as a team (on a giant whiteboard). Look for patterns in reactions and see if they answer the questions you came up with on Monday.</p><p>The best part is that you can&apos;t lose. Either you&apos;re on the right track, or you only spent five days exploring a tangent.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Now you can go test your ideas quickly! I won&apos;t use this for a while since I don&apos;t have a startup nor do I have a huge team. But what I do have is a Stanford interview tomorrow, so I&apos;m going to sleep now and then I&apos;ll have a great time talking with this guy!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunn Matchomatics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Disrupting a (potentially) million-dollar company in two days.

All of these matches (along with identifying data such as name, gender, grade) are flattened into an array and stored in a new <code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>To find the match-compatibility score, we can use Dylan Lu&apos;s magical love-matching algorithm. We give &quot;points&quot; for questions that are answered the same or very closely, and we give extra points for matching &quot;dependent&quot; questions (for example, I answered that I prefer girls with brown hair, and a girl answered they have brown hair).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/code-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Matchomatics" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="1552" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/code-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/code-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/code-1.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/code-1.png 1628w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dylan Lu&apos;s Magical Love-Matching Algorithm</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that we&apos;ve matched everyone, we&apos;ll need to convert the outputted <code>.csv</code> file into something printable and pretty.

<p>The <code>template.html</code> file is basically a giant wrapper that includes the basic boilerplate HTML needed and brings in Tailwind. We take all our data and pass it to a new <code>person.html</code>, which presents it in a pretty page format.</p>

I was a little skeptical&#x2014;<em>when was the last time he hung out with a college friend in California?</em>  <em>and why can&apos;t he get an Uber?</em>&#x2014;but I decided it wasn&apos;t that big of a deal. Then we got there, and I saw who it actually was: my little cousins, aunt, and uncle!</p><p>I missed my little cousins and aunt and uncle, so I was really excited and surprised to see them make a last-minute trip all the way from Beijing. My grandparents, on the other hand, burst out in tears. The whole family was together, and everyone was happy.</p><h2 id="before-christmas">Before Christmas</h2><p>I&apos;m not gonna lie, I left my Econ final an hour early because I was incredibly unmotivated to continue the test. I then played Elden Ring for 3 hours when I got home.</p><p>Speaking of Elden Ring, that&apos;s what I did literally all day for the next days, because I was super sad about <em>something.</em></p><p>But then I got over it. And I started writing my college apps again.</p><h2 id="christmas">Christmas</h2><p>Even though my parents made it absolutely clear that we would not get any gifts this year (the iPhone for our birthdays was good enough!), they called my sister and I down in the morning, and I got a 2TB SSD drive! I was genuinely excited, and it felt good knowing that my dad cared enough to surprise me with something I actually wanted.</p><p>My uncle (Yen Yen) got me cologne. I never thought about using cologne before, but, in my uncle&apos;s words, it&apos;s time for me to be a man now. So I started to wear it every day, and I think it smells pretty good!</p><p>Best of all, I now had enough Christmas + Birthday money to buy my latest toy: the iPad Pro. Why? Because now I can write all my notes digitally, and I can use it as a second monitor for my Macbook at school. My dad said that was a very gimmicky reason to drop $1k, but as they say, &quot;spend a lot on things you care about, but really save when it&apos;s something else.&quot; I&apos;m paraphrasing and I don&apos;t remember where I read it, but you get the point. Of course, that also meant I spent money on a &quot;paper&quot; screen protector with a special Apple pencil tip, and a really snug magnetic case/stand.</p><p>But now that I have an iPad Pro (and have joined the &quot;Macbook Pro, iPhone Pro, Airpods Pro, and iPad Pro&quot; family), I actually use it for things I&apos;d never thought I would. First off, my dad bought a recipe-making app, so I&apos;m learning to cook with it. I&apos;ve made chicken quesadillas so far (which are <em>so </em>good), and I&apos;m moving my way up to steak eventually. My dad also has Procreate, which is a drawing app. I&apos;m doing this thing where I draw a little bit (almost) everyday, and then see where I end up in a year/several months. Right now, I&apos;m drawing things from Zelda, Dragon Ball Z, and Elden Ring, and I&apos;ll hopefully get better as I progress.</p><p>To end Christmas, the whole family sang, I played violin (after not touching it for 6+ years), Jocelyn played clarinet, and Evelyn and Kevin played piano. Wai Po also gave us a math challenge for $100, and of course, I won it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765256670149345290/1194526466965250058/IMG_4448.jpg?ex=65b0ac76&amp;is=659e3776&amp;hm=d5b3d0eaad0920b5b2c82b77c89119bdcc231d2104cfddc0ab1751bd7ced52d2&amp;" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I&apos;m a Pro</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1470" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First Quesadilla</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-day-after">The Day After</h2><p>We went to Ruby Hill to eat lunch and play golf with Tyler Wong&apos;s family.

Jiu Jiu and Jiu Ma were nice enough to give feedback on my essays, leading us to an &quot;EE&quot; day&#x2014;exercise and essay day. Because the day before they left, that&apos;s all we did. Literally, from when I woke up at 7 AM to when I slept at 2 AM.</p><p>But looking back, EE day relieved a lot of future stress. I finished Harvard and MIT (both basically from scratch), Stanford, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia.

I was just thinking about how much stuff gets done in the first few months of school starting, which is why I pushed back my MIT application so I can have more time to write about them. Tomorrow is exactly one year after my last golf game with Dave, Ray, Bryan, and Grandpa at Ruby Hill, which is when I also asked Dave if he could help me with my LunchTrak project. Tomorrow is also the day I am meeting with Vypin&apos;s CEO to talk about potentially partnering up to deliver this LunchTrak solution for realsies. I&apos;m so scared, but I&apos;m excited; if everything goes well in the long term, I can definitely see myself getting 5% royalty on $100K a month. That&apos;s a life-changing amount of money.</p><p>It&apos;s also homecoming this week, which is crazy since it&apos;s the last one I&apos;ll ever have. Kinda sad really.</p><p>Edit (10/3/23): Damn bruh Vypin canceled the meeting and doesn&apos;t wanna do it anymore.</p><p>Edit 2 (1/11/23): Looking back on this old post, I talked about Vypin in my MIT, Stanford, and Ivys essays.

To be fully honest, I wanted to weasel my way out of it by saying something like &quot;Oh, I&apos;m taking a break&quot; or something similar, but they were persistent. When I told them that Bluetooth may not be the best solution, they suggested UWB and then asked whether we could talk over the phone. Coming off of my really nervous interview about Mr. Paley, I was scared, but I agreed. 10 minutes later I was on a call with Mark and Yuri.</p><h2 id="the-call">The Call</h2><p>Having pitched LunchTrak probably a hundred times already, explaining the gist of it was pretty easy, so I felt prepared. I then explained why Bluetooth wasn&apos;t the best solution because there&apos;s variation in signal strength and it isn&apos;t good when in a backpack. They responded by saying that their clients used Atmosic chips for asset tracking and it was perfectly fine, but agreed that having it in the backpack was tricky.</p><p>Both people were really nice and were willing to help brainstorm some ideas to solve my issues. I&apos;m actually really excited to get back into LunchTrak, and it&apos;s refreshing to know I&apos;m being productive again. Part of me wants to write about it in my college essay, but this is not why I&apos;m doing it. I am kinda nervous about college apps though. Regardless, there is a hard deadline soon because I will be graduating and will therefore not be physically present to debug and work with PAUSD (unless of course...)</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>Am I going back in? I hope so, and I hope that I can think about expanding the product to other use cases, not just the lunch line. Also, having it be a mobile app would make life a lot easier for the students, which might be an important requirement.</p><p>Dylan, please tell me that you didn&apos;t waste your senior year. This is your last year where you can start a &quot;business&quot; and everyone will support you because you are young. Also have fun and enjoy it.

When we present our project a few hours later, I brought that same energy and passion that I have when I explain anything I build.

A couple of days into the book, I was finally able to bring myself to lift at the gym every single day, and I still do it. Here&apos;s how this book can do the same for you.</p><h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2><p>Habits are incredibly powerful, and they determine who you are as a person. Getting 1% better every day will make you 37x better in a year. Sometimes, however, it is hard to get into a good habit or get rid of a bad one. The problem is not that you don&apos;t want to change, it&apos;s that you don&apos;t have the right system. There are 4 different &quot;laws&quot; to help you fix that.</p><h2 id="the-1st-law-make-it-obvious">The 1st Law: Make It Obvious</h2><p>If you want to go to the gym, prepare your gym bag and put it where you will always see it. By making the habit &quot;obvious&quot;, you are less likely to forget it. Moreover, it is easier to form new habits in new environments, since you are not fighting against old cues.</p><p>On the flip side, made bad habits invisible. If you play too much video games, maybe put the controller under your desk where you can&apos;t see it. This way, you will not be reminded about it all the time.</p><h3 id="habit-stacking">Habit Stacking</h3><p>This is a technique to make new habits obvious. The formula is &quot;After I [current habit], I will [new habit]&quot;. Basically, you will perform your new habit before or after something you already do, like eating breakfast or brushing your teeth.</p><h2 id="the-2nd-law-make-it-attractive">The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive</h2><p>The anticipation of a reward drives us to action, and greater anticipation leads to more dopamine in the brain. Make your &quot;hard&quot; habits attractive by bundling things you <em>need</em> to do with things you <em>want </em>to do. For me, I need to do more push-ups, so I do as many push-ups as I can before I allow myself to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (I do push-ups way too many times a day).</p><p>The inversion of this law is to make bad habits <em>unattractive</em>. One way is to highlight the benefits of avoiding the bad habit.</p><h3 id="use-other-people-to-shape-your-habits">Use Other People to Shape Your Habits</h3><p>We humans tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (friends and family), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). The easiest way to build better habits is to join groups or cultures where your desired habit is the norm. For example, my closest friends started going to the gym every day. Now, I go to the gym every day.</p><h2 id="the-3rd-law-make-it-easy">The 3rd Law: Make it Easy</h2><blockquote>&quot;Make it easy&quot; - Nathan Levy</blockquote><p>Stop planning and trying to be perfect. You learn more from taking action, which brings results and habits. You don&apos;t get fit by talking to your personal trainer; you do it by working out.</p><p>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is far less important than the number of times you actually do it. It doesn&apos;t matter if you exercise once a week for a year; doing five times a week for two months will probably form the habit better.</p><h3 id="the-law-of-least-effort">The Law of Least Effort</h3><p>Similar to &quot;make it obvious&quot;, we are more likely to perform our habits if it is easy and frictionless (we tend to gravitate towards the option that requires the least amount of work). Prime your environment to put your gym bag at the front door, putting your book at the dinner table, putting healthy snacks in the fridge, or anything that would make your good habit easier. On the other hand, make bad habits really hard to do. If you unplug your TV and put it in the garage, you probably will think twice before mindlessly binge-watching Netflix.</p><h3 id="two-minute-rule">Two Minute Rule</h3><p>Start small, and build up slowly. No new habit should take more than two minutes to perform. I used to be scared of going to the gym because of how many other people were there. On the first three days, I decided to drive over, do 3 sets, and then drive back home; it was incredibly short, but that made me willing to go through with it.</p><p>Standardize before you optimize. You can&apos;t improve a habit that doesn&apos;t exist.</p><h3 id="automation">Automation</h3><p>Automate your habits so that you don&apos;t need to think about performing good ones and avoiding bad ones. For example, you could set a screen time limit on your phone if you use too much social media. Or, you could use a meal delivery service to ensure you cook healthy foods. Technology is the best way to automate your habits.</p><p>Invest in one-time actions that lock in good habits. I bought a 3D printer so that I would continue creating and developing cool projects. A better example from the book is to enroll in an automatic savings plan.</p><h2 id="the-4th-law-make-it-satisfying">The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying</h2><p>Our bad habits often have immediate gratification, but lead to long-term unhappiness. Good habits are the opposite, which is why our brains sometimes want to avoid them. The secret to getting a habit to stick is to feel successful after performing a habit, even if it&apos;s just a little bit (maybe use an app to track your progress). The rule is: <em>What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</em></p><h3 id="habit-tracking">Habit Tracking</h3><p>Tracking your habits makes them obvious, attractive, and satisfying. You can use habit stacking to make sure you track your habits: &quot;After I [habit], I will [track my habit]&quot;. You don&apos;t, however, need to track everything. Some metrics are vanity metrics and do not help you find results. Wait you don&apos;t know what <em>vanity metrics</em> are?

Get back on track as soon as possible to keep your streak alive.</p><h3 id="accountability-partner">Accountability Partner</h3><p>Create a <em>habit contract</em> with a partner to keep you both accountable. This is just a verbal or written commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don&apos;t follow through. The best way to make a bad habit unsatisfying is to immediately painful at the moment.</p><p>You can even automate this process. Maybe if you don&apos;t wake up at 6:30 AM to run, your phone will automatically post on Instagram that says &quot;I&apos;m too lazy to wake up early and I will pay $5 to the first person who DMs me&quot;.</p><h2 id="advanced-tactics">Advanced Tactics</h2><h3 id="pick-the-right-habit">Pick the Right Habit</h3><p>Genes influence your personality and behavior, so you have a natural advantage/disadvantage in some areas. It is a lot easier to stick with a habit that matches your personality, so pick the ones that work for you.</p><p>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. If you have a natural talent for a particular area, you will likely find progress fun and easy. But if you pick the wrong habit, it&apos;s really hard to succeed.</p><p> Here are some questions to find your habit:</p><ul><li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</li><li>What makes me lose track of time?</li><li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</li><li>What comes naturally to me?</li></ul><p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us <em>what </em>to work hard on.</p><h3 id="stay-motivated">Stay Motivated</h3><p>Use the <em>Goldilocks Rule</em> to stay motivated. The rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. Hit flow state to become fully immersed in an activity.</p><p>Habits will eventually become boring and you will want to quit&#x2014;even if you are making good progress. The only way to become excellent is to fall in love with boredom; you must be fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. Anyone can work hard when they are motivated, but going when the work isn&apos;t exciting is what makes the difference.</p><h3 id="the-downside-of-good-habits">The Downside of Good Habits</h3><p>Once you practice enough, a habit becomes automatic. This dynamic can prevent you from thinking about how to get even better. The moment you feel like you mastered an activity is when you are at risk of complacency. You need deliberate practice on top of automatic habits to achieve the next level of mastery</p><p>In order to be conscious of your performance over time, you should reflect and review a couple of times a year. Doing so will prevent the gradual slide of your abilities over time.</p><p>Building habits early on can help you build your desired identity, but your new beliefs can also hold you back from the next level of growth. Keep your identity small and do not cling too tightly to a single identity. If your identity is &quot;star Varsity player&quot;, what happens after you graduate high school? Keep your identity flexible.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-71323">Final Remarks (7/13/23)</h2><p>I liked this book a lot because of how easy and effective it was to change my habits. Rereading parts of the book for this post reminded me of some key details that helped me continue to code every day even though it was getting a little boring. My improvement will compound as I continue to exercise my habits, and I know I will be a lot better in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[LunchTrak Summer Pilot]]></title><description><![CDATA[The culmination of all the hard work I put into LunchTrak.

I feel good enough to take a break and go to the gym.</p><p>It&apos;s 5:20 PM and I drive over to Atmosic. When I arrive, Ray is one of the only people in the lab. He seems to be really focused on something important. When I get there I see Tony leave and say bye to him; I think he was surprised to see me. Ray gives me a Joulescope and tells me to measure the current on my boards. Luckily, I have VBATT and GND test points on my board, so I soldered some copper wire to them and hooked up the Joulescope. As we analyzed the current, we noticed that the broken boards were not showing the beaconing pattern. We played around with BLE_adv settings and still could not find a beacon. We also pulled up a spectrum analyzer to confirm this. </p><p>We go to Ray&apos;s workspace and I hand him a broken board, my original prototype board, and an ATM2 module. He checks the schematics and probes around. When he goes to the solder station, he thinks that he shorted RFIO to GND. More testing showed that he didn&apos;t. That&apos;s when he realized the problem. There is supposed to be a DC block that will prevent current from leaking into the chip. There is supposed to be 3 megaohms resistance across RFIO to GND, but the broken boards show much less (around 300 ohms). This finding confirmed his suspicion that the boards had ESD damage, and he explained to me why ESD damage occurs. From my understanding, DC blocks (as the name suggests) do not allow DC to flow through (I think it is a capacitor). When you accidentally touch the pin, however, you might cause a sudden voltage drop or rise, meaning that there will be AC for a short amount of time. This causes the current to flow through the DC block and reach the chip, causing unrepairable damage.</p><p>As you can imagine, I was heartbroken. I didn&apos;t really know what to say to Ray except &quot;Thank you for helping me&quot;. For 10 minutes, I sat in my car holding back my tears. I called my Dad and told him what had happened. I was lightheaded on my drive back home and I couldn&apos;t think straight. The pilot was tomorrow, what would I say to them?</p><p>As I got home, my parents looked at me and knew what had happened. I didn&apos;t say anything and went into my room. When I came out, I took a quick shower and ate dinner. I explained to my parents what had just happened.</p><p>I&apos;m not going into the details of what happened next, but I think you (who is probably future me) already know what I was thinking and what I said to my Mom, and then to my Dad.</p><p>It was about 9 PM when I realized that not all the boards were damaged. I spent an hour testing all of the boards and found that 26 had functional RFIO. Of those boards, only 15 had functional WURX. I was happy to have had enough to actually run a quick test with my own Living Skills class. Still, I felt the lingering effects of what I had thought to be the end of my project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-13.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Graveyard of Broken Tags</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-12.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-12.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-12.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Working tags!</figcaption></figure><p>I went to sleep a little more optimistic about the pilot that would happen tomorrow.</p><h2 id="launch-day">Launch Day</h2><p>This is the big day, the day I&apos;ve waited 6 months for. I woke up naturally at 7 AM and immediately ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, and then ran some quick, last-minute tests with the system; it was all ready. I drove over to Gunn and went to the cafeteria. When I got there, I said hi to the lunch workers and set up my LunchTrak system on their computer. They didn&apos;t have any AC adapters, so I had to go to the tech office to ask for some. Syed drove me around campus in his golf cart and I actually got to see the server room in Gunn; he found a couple of old AC adapters and USB extenders there. I set the system up and went to class.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-14.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/06/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="LunchTrak Summer Pilot" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-15.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-15.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-15.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-15.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I think the teacher forgot about my thing (even though I reminded her at the beginning of class) because I didn&apos;t get to talk to the class about the project until 20 minutes before brunch. When I did, I gave a whole speech like &quot;Who here hates long lunch lines? I&apos;m working on a project to fix that&quot; blah blah. The students were initially confused but were willing to test it out. I handed the tags to most of the class (though some were the &quot;no wurx&quot; tags) and I helped them go through the pairing process. 5 minutes before lunch, everyone was set up, and I left class early to set up my camera in the lunch lines.</p><h3 id="brunch-time">Brunch Time</h3><p>Now the interesting part. I will show the video here before I talk about it (the real thing starts around 2:00).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

The biggest issue on my end is that my scanner would scan students in immediately as they entered the room, meaning that the lunch worker wouldn&apos;t see their names pop up as they left the room. This problem is hard to fix due to the unstable nature of RSSI and Bluetooth. The next problem that you might have seen is that numbers would combine into something like 95000000950000001 when someone is typing their number and a LunchTrak test is right behind them. This is a software issue on their end, but it is still something I have to consider when developing a new solution.</p><h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3><p>I was very disappointed but also surprisingly relieved that the pilot was over; all of my worries and stress just disappeared. I knew that I would need to update everyone who helped me with the project, so I tried thinking of ways to phrase how the pilot went. Here&apos;s the email I sent out.</p><hr><p>Hi All,</p><p>Just wanted to give you a quick update on my LunchTrak testing yesterday during summer school.</p><p>Due to a problem during manufacturing, many of the tags were damaged and only 26 of the 75 tags worked properly. I was at least able to hand the working ones out to my Living Skills class. Because there weren&apos;t that many tags, we ended up mixing the lines with both LunchTrak testers and students who typed their IDs. The problem is that when a student types their number into the software, there is a short delay before the software registers that number. If a student with LunchTrak is right behind, the two numbers might be combined, leading to something like 9500000195000002. We had to ask the students to retype their numbers. Another problem is that a couple of students were mistakenly picked up by my scanner upon entering the room, causing confusion when they tried to exit because their names would not show up again. I am still looking into why this problem occurred and how I can prevent it.</p><p>Though the pilot did not go exactly as I planned, there are some positive takeaways. The students who were scanned in correctly had no delay and enjoyed the convenience of not needing to enter their ID. At the very least, this experiment helped confirm the idea that skipping the keypads leads to time and convenience benefits. I just need to focus on ensuring the above issues do not happen.</p><p>Overall, I will be brainstorming and tinkering with potential fixes to solve the issues mentioned above. Thank you all for your help with my project. I will keep you updated on my progress.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Dylan</p><hr><p>So yeah, admit your faults early and then focus on the positives! (see my post on the book <a href="https://blog.dylanlu.com/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/?ref=localhost">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>)</p><h2 id="conclusion-lessons-and-whats-next">Conclusion, Lessons, and What&apos;s Next</h2><p>I spent 6 months building a product that didn&apos;t work. But it wasn&apos;t wasted: the students who were successfully scanned in loved the product and its speed + convenience factor). My &quot;<a href="https://blog.dylanlu.com/the-lean-startup/?ref=localhost">Lean Startup</a>&quot; Spidey-sense tells me that I had just confirmed my value hypothesis, but I will need to pivot on the underlying technology. If I had read the book earlier, I would know that 6 months is a wayyy too long turnaround time to run an experiment like this. I should have at least tested it with my friends earlier on.</p><p>Seeing the results of this experiment could easily make me depressed if I don&apos;t try seeing it from the positive side. For a first product, being able to demo it to PAUSD administrators, get them to pay for it, actually go through the manufacturing process, and have everything on time for a pilot is actually very encouraging news. I have the ability to get my ideas and products out there, I just need to focus on getting it to work next time (this should come easier as I learn more and get better). The fact that I have my own LLC should make me happy enough. I can give it a new name (maybe LuWang LLC, or probably something else) and make LunchTrak a DBA. Then I can make all my small businesses a DBA to my parent LLC. Dude, I have a business bank account and credit card. Why should I be upset?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure exactly what the future looks like for LunchTrak, but I do not intend on giving up right away. I will, however, take a small break from it to explore some other projects like my 3D Printed Guardian Sword, Gunn Alumni (complete pivot), and Gunn Elimination. I have a lot of cool things to work on this summer and I look forward to all of them. Okay, maybe not so much on my college essays.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Lean Startup]]></title><description><![CDATA[Notes on Eric Ries' The Lean Startup.

Jon Paris (from my small group) also vouched for the book, so I became really interested in reading it. The book is mostly about how to run a successful startup and prevent failure by following a quick, effective process. The five basic principles are:</p><ol><li>Entrepreneurs are everywhere</li><li>Entrepreneurship is management</li><li>Use <em>validated learning</em></li><li>Use <em>innovation accounting</em></li><li>Use <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> feedback loop</li></ol><h2 id="vision">Vision</h2><p>Many startups fail, but success can be engineered when following the right process. What Eric Ries proposes generally goes against what most of think about companies. For example, he defines entrepreneurship as a form of management, despite their opposite connotations (entrepreneurs hate management!).</p><h3 id="start">Start</h3><p>Use <em>learning milestones </em>to track progress rather than focusing on metrics that, while seemingly indicate progress, are not a sustainable measure to evaluate how the company is really doing.</p><p>Startups should focus on building the right thing (what customers will want and pay for) as quickly as possible. Instead of making a complex plan and following it for months, use the <em>Build-Measure-Learn</em> feedback loop to get results faster. As the name suggests, you want to quickly create/modify a product, run an experiment to see how customers react, and use the findings to make better improvements.</p><p>Your <em>vision </em>is the fundamental change you want to see in the world. Your <em>strategy</em> is how you will accomplish this goal, and includes the business model, product road map, assumptions on who customers are, and more. Your <em>product</em> is the result of the strategy and will constantly evolve as you optimize.</p><h3 id="define">Define</h3><p>Startup: a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty</p><p>Innovation: though unpredictable, it can still be managed</p><p>Leadership: creating conditions that enable employees to do the kinds of experimentation that entrepreneurship requires</p><h3 id="learn">Learn</h3><p>Customers do not know what they want in a product; asking them is therefore useless. Instead, figure out what they want by their actions or inactions (study how they interact with the product, usually by getting volunteers and conducting in-person tests). Any action that does not contribute to learning about what creates value to customers is a waste.</p><p>It&apos;s possible to build most products. The more important question, however, is &quot;Should the product be built?&quot; and &quot;Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?&quot;</p><h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3><p>Do not &quot;Just do it&quot; when it comes to launching a product. If you fail, you won&apos;t get the validated learning necessary to adapt your product. Instead, test a small idea to answer big questions (Zappos wanted to test the assumption that there was a demand for buying shoes online, so they took pictures of another store&apos;s shoes and sold them on their website).</p><p>Find <em>early adopters</em>, which are customers who most eagerly want the product. They tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and will be willing to give feedback. </p><p>Success is about learning to solve customer&apos;s problems, not just delivering new features.</p><p>An experiment is more than just a theoretical inquiry; it is also a first product. If any experiment is successful, managers can start enlisting early adopters and hiring employees.</p><p><strong>Important Assumptions Every Startup Makes</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Value Hypothesis:</strong> Does the product actually bring value to customers? Use experiments, not surveys, to prove it.</li><li><strong>Growth Hypothesis:</strong> How will new customers discover the product? </li></ol><p><strong>Questions For Product Development</strong></p><ol><li>Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?</li><li>If there was a solution, would they buy it?</li><li>Would they buy it from us?</li><li>Can we build a solution for that problem?</li></ol><h2 id="steer">Steer</h2><p>The products that a startup builds are actually experiments; learning how to build a sustainable business is the outcome. Use an MVP to experiment and test your most important assumptions (value and growth hypothesis). The MVP is the version of the product that allows the quickest cycle of the <em>Build-Measure-Learn </em>feedback loop while also expending the least effort. Even if you are on time and on budget, it doesn&apos;t matter if you build something no one wants.</p><p>For example, Facebook validated their value hypothesis after realizing that half of their users used the site everyday. It is clear that the product is valuable to customers.</p><h3 id="leap">Leap</h3><p>Use a strategy to figure out the right questions to ask. A startup&apos;s early efforts should be focused on testing the right assumptions as quickly as possible.</p><p>Successful entrepreneurs discover which parts of their plans are working and which aren&apos;t. Being &quot;at the right time and place&quot; is not enough.</p><h3 id="test">Test</h3><p>First products are not meant to be perfect. In fact, early adopters can be suspicious when a product is too polished. Therefore, adding additional features beyond what is needed for the experiments is wasteful, especially when it slows down the experiments. Depending on what industry you&apos;re in, the MVP can be super complicated (like a working prototype) or as simple as an ad. Focus on what assumptions you need to test and how you&apos;ll test them.</p><p>If you don&apos;t know who the customer is, you don&apos;t know what quality is. Ask them what features in the design they care about, as it may differ from what you think matters most.</p><p>The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else. Remove features from the MVP that do not contribute directly to the learning you seek, and start the process of validated learning as soon as possible.</p><h3 id="types-of-mvps">Types of MVPs</h3><ul><li>Video MVP: Explain the concept and ask people to sign up.</li><li>Concierge MVP: Do everything yourself to create an awesome, personalized experience. For example, a grocery delivery app might have the CEO personally delivering it to a customer to make the experience the best for the customer.</li><li>Wizard of Oz MVP: Simulate the technology you would need to develop by doing it yourself behind the scenes.</li></ul><h3 id="measure">Measure</h3><p>How do you know if you are making the product better? A good design is one that will change customer behavior for the better. To measure, you need a clear baseline metric, a hypothesis about what will improve that metric, and a set of experiments to test that hypothesis. Split testing is a good way to test different versions of a product, letting you know what matters to them and what does not.</p><p>Progress is measured by evidence that a sustainable business can be built around the product or service. Measure your productivity according to validated learning, not in terms of adding new features.</p><p><strong>The 3 A&apos;s of Metrics</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Clear cause and effect between experiment and metric</li><li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Make the reports as simple as possible so everyone understands them</li><li><strong>Auditable: </strong>You must be able to test the data by hand</li></ol><h3 id="innovation-accounting">Innovation Accounting</h3><p>Jon Paris told me that this is the most important part of the book. Innovation accounting is a way for startups to objectively prove they are learning how to grow a sustainable business. By getting rid of vanity metrics (misleading metrics that seem to suggest growth) and replacing them with learning milestones, can be kept accountable for their decisions.</p><p>First, establish an MVP to get real data on where the company is right now. Next, tune the engine &quot;towards the ideal&quot; by making all the optimizations and changes possible. When the possibilities are exhausted, the company must make a decision: pivot or preserve.</p><h3 id="pivot-or-preserve">Pivot Or Preserve</h3><p>The true measure of a runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy. When entrepreneurs have unclear hypotheses, it&apos;s almost impossible to experience complete failure, which is a necessary force to promote radical change and pivots.</p><p>Start now because you will never learn what needs to change without launching. Be careful though, since low-quality MVPs only work for early adopters; mainstream customers have higher demands for their products.</p><p>A pivot is a new strategic hypothesis that will require a new MVP to test. Optimization, tuning, and iteration are all methods to test a clear hypothesis in the service of the company&apos;s vision.</p><h3 id="types-of-pivots">Types of Pivots</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>Zoom-in:</strong></strong> A single feature becomes the whole product.</li><li><strong><strong>Zoom-out:</strong></strong> What was considered the whole product becomes a feature of something much larger.</li><li><strong><strong>Customer segment:</strong></strong> We have built a product that solves a real problem for real customers, but they are not the customers we originally planned to serve.</li><li><strong><strong>Customer need: </strong></strong>The problem we were trying to solve turns out to not be very important. However, we discover related problems that are important in the process.</li><li><strong><strong>Platform:</strong></strong> Change from an application to a platform or vice versa</li><li><strong><strong>Business architecture:</strong></strong> High margin, low volume versus low margin, high volume. Or B2B versus B2C.</li><li><strong><strong>Value capture:</strong></strong> How you decide to make money.</li><li><strong><strong>Engine of growth:</strong></strong> Change in strategy to seek faster, more profitable growth.</li><li><strong><strong>Channel:</strong></strong> Change your distribution channel.</li><li><strong><strong>Technology:</strong></strong> Achieve the same solution with a different technology.</li></ul><h2 id="accelerate">Accelerate</h2><h3 id="batch">Batch</h3><p>Testing in smaller batches leads to faster learning. The ability to learn faster from customers is an essential competitive advantage because it means you can roll out new features and validate them quicker. For example, I could quickly manufacture 100 products and learn from it even though I would get a much better price per for 1000 of them.</p><h3 id="grow">Grow</h3><p>Your engine of growth is how startups achieve sustainable growth, which is when you get new customers coming in as the result of the actions of past customers. Measuring performance in the following engines of growth give good indicators on how well the startup is doing.</p><p><strong>3 Engines of Growth</strong></p><ol><li>Sticky Engine: The rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the <em>churn rate </em>(percent of users who stopped using the product)</li><li>Viral Engine: The <em>viral coefficient</em> (how many more users join for each new member) is above 1</li><li>Paid Engine: The customer lifetime value outweigh the cost of advertisement</li></ol><h3 id="adapt">Adapt</h3><p>Training your team to think &quot;lean&quot; is difficult, though important. Most mistakes are caused by flawed systems, not bad people. Always try to figure out how to prevent those situations in the future. To understand the root causes of failure, use the &quot;Five Whys&quot;</p><p><strong>The Five Whys</strong></p><ol><li>Use it for every major problem</li><li>Setup a meeting with everyone involved, or who is affected by the problem</li><li>Ask &quot;why did the problem happen?&quot; and then ask why to each subsequent answer until you have reached the solution</li></ol><p>Example: </p><p>Why did the website go down? The server crashed</p><p>Why did the server crash? The free tier expired on AWS</p><p>Why were we not notified about nearing the usage limits? We were, but the email was sent to an old company account.</p><p>Why was it sent to the old company account? We did not update our company information</p><p>Why did we not update our company information? Don&apos;t know. Maybe we should update the company information.</p><h3 id="innovate">Innovate</h3><p>Do not make the mistake of splitting off teams into parts like &quot;frontend&quot;, &quot;design&quot;, &quot;communications&quot;. Oftentimes, your employees will need to be involved in multiple sections of the company to get their work done. Therefore, you want teams that are cross-functional, removing the need for your employees to go through ten different people to answer questions.</p><p><strong>3 Structural Attributes For a Startup</strong></p><ol><li>Scarce but secure resources</li><li>Independent authority to develop the business</li><li>Personal stake in the company&apos;s outcome</li></ol><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><p>Waste comes from working on the wrong things, not doing them inefficiently. Working on something useless at high speeds is completely wasteful, so don&apos;t do it.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-61323">Final Remarks (6/13/23)</h2><p>I spit-balled a lot of vocab words, but what do they really mean? I really suggest picking up the book and reading it through; it will clarify a lot of the concepts that I summarized in this post.</p><p>This book was probably the most enjoyable and immediately applicable for me. I read this book about 3 months ago, before I had any idea what I would be doing with LunchTrak over the summer. Exposure to these ideas helps me clearly see what strategies I can be using to achieve validated learning, which is the most important idea I took away from the book (Jon Paris said innovation accounting and he is pretty successful). I like this idea mainly because it makes startups seem so much more simple: all they need to focus on is learning how customers react to their product and how they can get more products.</p><p>This was a pretty long post, but I&apos;ll update it in the future if I remember any important ideas that I missed.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
