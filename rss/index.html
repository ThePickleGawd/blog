Yes, I did it! I convinced the Food Services people to pilot LunchTrak over the summer. I think the <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> book helped since I listened more and let them think that some ideas were their own (even when I was already thinking it), like splitting two lines for &apos;express lane&apos; or piloting the program over the summer where there are fewer people&quot;</p><p>-- My notebook (3/22/23)</p><hr><p><em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> completely changed how I deal with other people. Combining some ideas from this book and the <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, my new approach to solving disputes and asking for favors was wildly more successful. For instance, I had a lot of success in my meetings for the LunchTrak project, which we are going to pilot over summer school. I never wrote any notes in my notebook, so I will summarize whatever I can remember here.</p><h3 id="a-persons-name-is-to-him-or-her-the-sweetest-and-most-important-sound-in-any-language">&quot;A person&apos;s name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language&quot;</h3><p>Make it a priority never to forget someone&apos;s name (especially if you think you&apos;ll ask them for a favor in the future). I remember some kid in my Analysis class was like, &quot;What&apos;s your name again?&quot;, and it was really annoying. The point is, DO NOT forget people&apos;s names.</p><p>Remembering peoples&apos; names makes them feel important, which is what all of us want at the end of the day (at least according to Dale Carnegie). Use this knowledge to your advantage and build better relationships with other people.</p><h3 id="how-to-get-what-you-want">How to Get What You Want</h3><p>Stop criticizing, arguing, or complaining; it&apos;s really annoying. Instead, you should be open to the other person&apos;s ideas and be genuinely interested in what they have to say. Related to this idea (but from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People</em>) is that you should always listen and understand the problem before you respond (Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood). If you want people to listen to you, you need to them to feel like you&apos;re listening to them first.</p><p>People are generally interested in what <em>they </em>want. If you want something, you have to show them how it will help them get what they want. For example, if I wanted the school to pilot my LunchTrak program, I would emphasize how it would make their lives easier because they don&apos;t have to futz around with barcode scanners and keypads. A quote from the book: &quot;Arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.&quot;</p><h3 id="get-people-to-like-you">Get People to Like You</h3><p>If you want people to be interested in you, be genuinely interested in the other person. Listen to how they are feeling and build a good relationship with them, instead of focusing on what you want. You also want to make the other person feel important, but you don&apos;t want to be insincere (this can be seen from a mile away). One way to do this is to &quot;be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise&quot; (quoted like a million times in the book). Overall, just be a genuine person and people will like you.</p><h3 id="other-tips-for-getting-people-to-agree-with-you">Other Tips For Getting People to Agree With You</h3><p>Be respectful to the other person. Never say &quot;you&apos;re stupid&quot; or &quot;you&apos;re wrong&quot;. What&apos;s the point of insulting someone who you want to agree with you? If you are wrong on anything, be quick to admit it and be empathetic (apologize). Try starting out as friendly as possible to build trust, and try truly seeing things from the other person&apos;s point of view. If you can&apos;t get someone to agree with your reasoning, try appealing to a nobler motive. An example from the book is when a famous person wanted to get his kid&apos;s pictures removed from a news article, he told the reporter that their mother is worried about their safety. It&apos;s hard to argue with a mother&apos;s desire to keep her kids safe.</p><h3 id="how-to-be-a-leader">How to Be a Leader</h3><p>Before you point out other people&apos;s mistakes, start with your own mistakes first. This will come out as less offensive and could prevent negative feelings. Speaking of mistakes, try to call them out indirectly when possible. For instance, you could ask someone how the company can ensure the server doesn&apos;t crash in the future instead of blaming them for crashing the server.</p><p>Another strategy to get people to listen is to give them a reputation to live up to. This idea is related to how people want to feel important; if you tell the company that John is the best web developer you&apos;ve ever met, he&apos;ll be motivated to show that he is the best. Similarly, you want people to be happy and excited doing the things that you want. It is really hard to motivate someone to do something they hate, so try spinning the task in a way that seems fun.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-6423">Final Remarks (6/4/23)</h2><p>I listened to this book in the car on the way to school every day for a couple of weeks, and I am glad I did so. Working well with other people and building relationships is one of the most important aspects of anyone&apos;s career regardless of what they want to do. Especially for me&#x2013;since I want to learn about entrepreneurship&#x2013;learning to work with people is a must. I hope to put these ideas into practice in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dylan's Book Notes - Zero to One]]></title><description><![CDATA[Notes on Peter Thiel's Zero to One.

Another important idea that I like is that leaders need to hire people smarter than themselves. I heard the same thing from many other talks, I think Mark Zuckerberg even said that in a Harvard talk. Overall, this book was really interesting to read and easy to follow.

There are only two weeks before it starts and there is still a lot I need to get done.

I figured out the wake-up receiver matching with Andy and tested it out with Dave. The range is really good for a 30dbm gain. I have a 20dbm RF amplifier which gives about 2.5 meters wake-up range, but it is not practical. I&apos;m currently waiting for my 30dbm amplifier to come on eBay.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image-3.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/image-3.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tag (center), Scanner (left), Amplifier (right)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="pcbway-assembly-order">PCBWay Assembly Order</h2><p>Well, this is a mess...</p><p>I placed my order for my PCB assembly almost a month ago, and there have been many problems and obstacles since. The major one that&apos;s been keeping me up at night is the miscommunication between PCBWay and Siqore which almost shut down my entire project; I was told that the ATM2 Modules could not be shipped to Taiwan. My first thought was that it was because of the US-China chip wars, and I became really depressed for 5 minutes. I then looked up what the trade restrictions were and found that they only apply to high-performance chips, a rule which does not apply in my situation. After sending multiple emails and calling PCBWay a couple of times (thank God my dad knows Chinese because the lady did not understand me at all), I think the issue has been resolved. The part should ship to China in the next 2 days, which is much faster than the 20-day timeline I originally thought it would be.</p><p>Another big problem (and good learning experience I guess) is that my GND pin on the battery holder was not connected to anything. This is a big problem, and I would not have caught this if PCBWay did not send an email asking whether to put solder paste on the center of the battery holder pad. See the image below. Notice how the circle is not green?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="780" height="414" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-4.png 780w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The $100 mistake</figcaption></figure><p>The previous drawing did not connect the pin to GND, even though it looks like it should.

Luckily, it didn&apos;t, and it only set me back $100. Imagine if the broken boards shipped and none of them worked...</p><h2 id="the-case">The Case</h2><p>This part is kinda fun.</p><p>Because we are not dealing with small 3D-printed batches anymore, the cost to print all 75 cases on JLCPCB is about $160. Crazy right? I&apos;m sure that&apos;s probably cheaper than elsewhere, but that brings my product up $2 per part more than it should be, and would also cause me to exceed my budget. Luckily PAUSD included tax when they mailed the check, so I got an extra $75 to compensate for some other costs I did not account for (like how PCBWay charged extra for supplying parts).</p><p>Instead of paying JLCPCB to print them for me, and then wait 2 weeks for them to ship, I decided to do something more fun: I&apos;d use the money that the school paid me to buy my own 3D printer, and then print the 75 cases with that. I ended up buying the Creality Ender S1 Pro, which is a great hobbyist printer that cost me $390 (on sale from $500). Yes, this is more than my budget, but I was able to split the cost after a kind investment from my sister. Basically, she would also be able to use the printer and she would be able to cash out 5% of my profits at any time she wants. Pretty good deal for me I would say, I got a 3D printer for free!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Final Weeks Before LunchTrak&apos;s Launch" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image-6.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Printing a Prototype Case</figcaption></figure><p>While it is cool to have my own 3D printer, there are some notable drawbacks.

Well, three disappointed years later, I&apos;m halfway toward fulfilling the prophecy.</p><h2 id="why-an-llc">Why An LLC?</h2><p>Because the PAUSD school district is not allowed to pay students directly, I need to set up an LLC that will receive money and buy the parts for the LunchTrak tags. Actually, I just got a call from Derek today about how the school could directly pay the manufacturers for the parts, though I told him it&apos;ll be more fun just to have the LLC do that. I expect the whole formation process to take about 10 days.</p><h2 id="step-1-naming-the-llc">Step 1. Naming the LLC</h2><p>That&apos;s pretty easy: LunchTrak LLC</p><p>My uncle suggested that I go with LunchTrak, LLC (with the comma), but I don&apos;t really like how that looks. He said it&apos;s fine either way.</p><h2 id="step-2-registered-agent">Step 2. Registered Agent</h2><p>There are two options here: either I could pay for a registered agent service, or I could appoint someone I know to be the agent. The only downside is that the address will be public and I will need to be careful with managing my mail.</p><p>I think, for now, I&apos;ll appoint my Grandma as my registered agent.</p><h2 id="step-3-articles-of-organization">Step 3. Articles of Organization</h2><p>I&apos;ll need to file some basic information with the California Secretary of State. Luckily, the $70 is waived for all new applicants until June 2023. Perfect timing!</p><p>Filing online is faster: <a href="https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/?ref=localhost">https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/</a></p><h2 id="step-4-initial-statement-of-information">Step 4. Initial Statement of Information</h2><p>The Statement of Information is due within the first 90 days of the LLC formation, and I&apos;ll need to resubmit one every other year. Obviously, I&apos;m making myself the CEO &#x1F60A;. I also made my dad a manager in case we need to sign some legal-bounding contracts.</p><h2 id="step-5-operating-agreement">Step 5. Operating Agreement</h2><p>The operating agreement is for my personal records only, so I won&apos;t actually need to submit anything. It is really only useful in case of legal issues (where founders could reference the Operating Agreement later on). I just used a template my uncle gave me because I don&apos;t think I have anything specific to change.</p><h2 id="step-6-obtaining-ein">Step 6. Obtaining EIN</h2><p>Obtaining my EIN for the company was really easy. All I needed to do was go to the IRS website to fill out my application online, and I got my EIN right away. Sadly, they only allow you to file online once in your life, so for my next company, I&apos;ll need to learn what the heck a fax machine is.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Great! Now I have a company. I&apos;m really excited about the pilot this summer and I hope it ends up working well. In preparation, I&apos;ve been reading a book called &quot;The Lean Startup&quot;, which is giving me a better understanding of what startups are and how I can learn to build one. It mentioned that startups really are just experiments and that I should collect data as quickly as possible so that I can make quick decisions and move my business forward. I think the summer pilot is a perfect way to get validation on the product and see if it has the potential to be a full-blown company. In the meantime, I am currently working on ordering the 75 devices from PCBWay, and I&apos;ll update this blog with my progress.</p><p>Side Note (new website!): <a href="https://lunchtrak.com/?ref=localhost">https://lunchtrak.com</a></p><p>Keywords for SEO (maybe?): LunchTrak, LunchTrack, Lunch Track, Lunch Trak, Wireless Lunch Line, Fast Lunch Line, Speed up slow lunch lines.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Forming LunchTrak LLC" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="975" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Landing Page</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Forming LunchTrak LLC" loading="lazy" width="1914" height="972" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/image-2.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/image-2.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/05/image-2.png 1914w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Pairing Tags</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[RSSI Calibration For Better BLE Proximity]]></title><description><![CDATA[Exploring a potential solution for RSSI issues in my LunchTrak project]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/rssi-calibration-for-better-ble-proximity/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">642225fda6f6b925806dbe5b</guid><category><![CDATA[LunchTrak]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 04:53:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/PA_Image-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/PA_Image-1.jpg" alt="RSSI Calibration For Better BLE Proximity"><p>After meeting with Dave over lunch, we came up with the idea to &quot;calibrate&quot; the RSSI threshold for the check-in system before the student walks to the exit. The problem with how it is currently set up is that depending on the orientation of the beacon, the RSSI can significantly differ from other beacons, meaning that there is no &quot;perfect&quot; RSSI threshold to check students in. Here&apos;s how I imagine this new calibration system:</p><ul><li>The &quot;calibration&quot; scanners come either at the entrance or can be placed behind the real scanners (at least 1-2 meters).</li><li>They will record the maximum average RSSI for any student ID and will report this number to the main scanner. Any filtering techniques will be applicable</li><li>The main scanner will now look for the RSSI threshold set by the calibration scanner</li></ul><p>One problem I envision right away is that if someone is walking around the exit (who did not go to the line), the calibration scanner will detect a lower RSSI and allow the main scanner to scan them in. This behavior is a huge issue. I think the best solution to this problem is to have a bare minimum RSSI that the calibration and main sensor must meet, like -70dbm for example.</p><p>Randomly, here&apos;s my new packet design to handle the calibrator vs extender packet. The &quot;-80&quot; will be replaced with the actual RSSI, and the five digits are the student ID numbers without the &quot;950&quot;.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="RSSI Calibration For Better BLE Proximity" loading="lazy" width="394" height="117"><figcaption>Calibrator/Extender Packet</figcaption></figure><p>Update (4/23/23): It&apos;s been two months and I have procrastinated on writing this article for too long. The calibration kinda works, but it is actually not needed. The people will be very close to the scanner and will likely not block the RSSI too much.

With only 7 weeks to go, I have a lot of work before I am ready to get all of my LunchTrak tags manufactured and shipped. One of the biggest things to do beforehand, however, is to get a final invoice ready for the school to review and decide whether they want to pay. I&apos;ve always had an estimate of how much the parts would cost overall, but I will need a more succinct list. That&apos;s where the Bill of Materials (or BOM) comes in. The BOM is mainly used to tell the manufacturers what parts I want to use in my PCB and where they should source them, but it also helps give a final price for the board. Originally, I was too lazy to research which parts to use, and that is partly because I didn&apos;t know where to look. Luckily, some Redditors suggested <a href="https://octopart.com/?ref=localhost">Octopart </a>because of its powerful search engine for parts.</p><h2 id="researching-parts">Researching Parts</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making a BOM to Get LunchTrak Tags Ready for Manufacturing" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="983" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/image-1.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/04/image-1.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Octopart</figcaption></figure><p>For example, if I wanted to find a resistor component with a specific resistance, I would go to Passive Components --&gt; Resistors --&gt; Chip SMD Resistors and then filter out the right footprint and resistance values.

PCBWay, which is the manufacturer that I will most likely use, does support user-submitted parts, but it is kinda annoying to have to do that in the first place. Oh well, I guess we&apos;ll see how that goes.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost Cards Work On Editor, But Not Preview]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stupid bug...]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/ghost-cards-work-on-editor-but-not-preview/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64227697689eb75618ecd9d5</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 05:19:20 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/cards_hu530bde54718f2b313fb590dbef31cd87_116580_932x0_resize_q100_h2_box_3.webp" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/cards_hu530bde54718f2b313fb590dbef31cd87_116580_932x0_resize_q100_h2_box_3.webp" alt="Ghost Cards Work On Editor, But Not Preview"><p>There is a bug in hosting Ghost locally on a Windows computer, where your cards work in the editor, but not preview: </p><p>See how the &quot;test &quot;header works here (editor)?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Ghost Cards Work On Editor, But Not Preview" loading="lazy" width="1702" height="885" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-14.png 1702w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Editor</figcaption></figure><hr><p></p><p>But in the preview, it does not work.

I finally learned how to use Fusion 360.</p><p>For a couple of months now, I&apos;ve been way too lazy to learn new complex software for my LunchTrak project, causing me to use online tools like EasyEDA (for PCB design) and TinkerCAD (for 3d printing). Yes, I still use EasyEDA because my schematics are so simple and because their platform gives me free coupons, but it may be beneficial in the future to learn something like KiCAD. Well today, I finally broke out of my shell and took on Fusion360. If you&apos;d like, here&apos;s my old case with TinkerCAD.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="1017" height="621" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-6.png 1017w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The lid doesn&apos;t work, and it&apos;s a pain changing things</figcaption></figure><p>I then started to open Fusion360. I&apos;m not gonna lie, I did not want to watch a 60-minute tutorial on how to use it, so I just messed around and clicked things until I got things to look how I wanted them to. For the first hour, I didn&apos;t even realize you could change the dimensions of sketches and boxes, so I had to delete and restart the entire model when I made a mistake. Another thing that was kind of trippy was the orthographic view. Having done a lot of development with Unity and Blender, it is incredibly mind-twisting to see the models from such a weird angle (edit: as I took the picture below, I accidentally figured out how to change it to perspective mode, which is what I&apos;m used to). I ended up just using the box at the top right to get the right view that I wanted.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="565" height="328"><figcaption>The box thing is really nice</figcaption></figure><p>For my new lid design, I decided to copy off of the case that Dave gave me, which has a little sliding thing. This is what I ended up with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="442" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-8.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-8.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/image-8.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-8.png 2261w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sliding thingy</figcaption></figure><p>And it looks pretty cool. I also added some text to make the case more personal, and I added a hole for the buttons. In a later version, I&apos;ll probably embed the buttons in the case or something cool like that. Here&apos;s the final product.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="1531" height="815" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-9.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-9.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-9.png 1531w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Final Product</figcaption></figure><p>That was pretty fun to make.
