Winter quarter finals were super easy (I ended up with 99+% overall in all my classes), and I finally secured an internship for the summer. It was kinda crazy. The HR guy called me right as I got out of the shower so I was literally half naked talking to this dude about my start/end dates and salary expectations. The next time he called, I was in Hawaii eating some delicious egg benedicts with my friends; I&apos;d gotten the offer for Software/ML intern.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/03/image.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Spring Break 2025 - Hawaii" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1389" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/03/image.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Waikiki - Eggs &apos;N Things</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="golf-fu-interview">Golf, Fu, Interview</h2><p>When I first arrived back in California, Fuey wanted to drive me up to Berkeley to see James and Chen. It was his second-to-last day of Spring break, but I told him I couldn&apos;t since I had an interview the next day. All morning I was stressing out about how to perfectly pitch my experiences and resume. I went for like a 30 minute walk around my block just to keep the stress off my mind. But as soon as we started the interview, I calmed down. There were no &quot;explain a time you had to...&quot; or any typical B.S. questions. We mostly talked about my resume and classes to gauge what I&apos;d be best at.</p><p>By the time the interview was over, I was so excited. I knew I had it in the bag once we started talking about Elden Ring. But funnily enough, at the end of the interview, he asked me if I knew what a transistor was. I said no lol and he was like &quot;yeah so we&apos;re going to put you on the software team.&quot; Nice.</p><p>Afterwards, I asked my dad what a transistor was and he explained to me how it&apos;s kinda like a switch. He showed me how they made NAND gates and how they were manufactured, and I was like, &quot;OH, we did this in class!&quot; It made sense now.</p><h3 id="golf">Golf</h3><p>For some reason, Fuey and Hayden wanted to play at three different courses, so we ended up playing 27 holes for a total of 6 hours. I liked Pruneridge (the last course) the best, and Sunken and Blackberry next. Sunken had some good BBQ though.</p><p>All the holes were par 3 or 4, so it wasn&apos;t that tiring. In the last course, my golf instinct turned on and I hit 3 pars and 1 birdie!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/04/image.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Spring Break 2025 - Hawaii" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/image.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/image.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/image.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/04/image.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sunken Gardens</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/04/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Spring Break 2025 - Hawaii" loading="lazy" width="1179" height="1502" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/04/image-1.png 1179w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2nd Birdie at Pruneridge?

Chen said that the season finale was the best TV episode he&apos;s ever seen across all shows.</p><p>Once we landed, James picked us up in yet another raggedy minivan. At least the doors opened by themselves. His mom bought us some goodies before she left, which was very considerate.</p><h3 id="food">Food</h3><p>We ate a lot of food during this trip, from Hawaiian BBQ to poke and even ramen.

I wanted to make a fully immersive Chinese learning game so that I could finally catch up on the 8 years since I&apos;ve dropped out of Chinese school. It&apos;s a decision I still kinda regret today (really, my Chinese speaking is utterly embarrassing).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="VR Chinese Learning with Speaking and Zombies" loading="lazy" width="714" height="425" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/03/image.png 714w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Can you believe this was 4 years ago!</span></figcaption></figure><p>But with ChatGPT Realtime Conversations, this is totally possible!

For my project proof-of-concept, I instead opted to give rewards to players when they correctly spoke good Chinese. For example, in a Zombie game, rewards could be ammo or new weapons.</p><p>You can see the demo below. At the beginning, when I asked for ammo, it actually clipped through the ground as it spawned in... so that&apos;s a little awkward.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEfnGCmj86o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Run From Duo VR - Demo"></iframe></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://github.com/ThePickleGawd/run-from-duo?ref=localhost"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">GitHub - ThePickleGawd/run-from-duo: Duolingo but it&#x2019;s VR and he&#x2019;s trying to kidnap you.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Duolingo but it&#x2019;s VR and he&#x2019;s trying to kidnap you. - ThePickleGawd/run-from-duo</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/pinned-octocat-093da3e6fa40.svg" alt="VR Chinese Learning with Speaking and Zombies"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">GitHub</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">ThePickleGawd</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://opengraph.githubassets.com/8ea0d82c05bff3a0882d99b556c4c8f6c148fda256b263acb00a8d9631febdee/ThePickleGawd/run-from-duo" alt="VR Chinese Learning with Speaking and Zombies"></div></a></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/03/demo-smaller.gif" class="kg-image" alt="VR Chinese Learning with Speaking and Zombies" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Gameplay</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="building-the-game">Building the Game</h2><p>I spent a long time watching Youtube tutorials on Unity XR since that was all new to me.

reward the player in the game, we need some way for ChatGPT to communicate that it thinks the player deserves a reward. To do this, I relied on OpenAI Function Calling protocol.

This approach gives core information for reasoning score updates by an auto-referee system. We also publish a multi-task dataset OpenTTGames with videos of table tennis games in 120 fps labeled with events, semantic segmentation masks, and ball coordinates for evaluation of multi-task approaches, primarily oriented on spotting of quick events and small objects tracking. TTNet demonstrated 97.0% accuracy in game events spotting along with 2 pixels RMSE in ball detection with 97.5% accuracy on the test part of the presented dataset. The proposed network allows the processing of downscaled full HD videos with inference time below 6 ms per input tensor on a machine with a single consumer-grade GPU. Thus, we are contributing to the development of real-time multi-task deep learning applications and presenting approach, which is potentially capable of substituting manual data collection by sports scouts, providing support for referees&#x2019; decision-making, and gathering extra information about the game process.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="SLAM-TT: Visualize Ping Pong in 3D!"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">arXiv.org</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Roman Voeikov</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png" alt="SLAM-TT: Visualize Ping Pong in 3D!"></div></a></figure><h3 id="wham">WHAM</h3><p>This project takes videos of humans and finds their pose and world position.

Basically, the goal was to take an instruction represented in hex (for example: <code>0x014B4820</code>), and parse it into something easier for me to work with. I decided to build my own Python type based on the MIPS reference card.</p>

I started with a map from the opcode/funct parameter to the corresponding function definition. I made a dict for R, I, and J types.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a MIPS Assembly Interpreter in Python" loading="lazy" width="1356" height="786" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/code-2.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/code-2.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-2.png 1356w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">functions.py</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, I grinded out each function.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a MIPS Assembly Interpreter in Python" loading="lazy" width="1636" height="444" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/code-5.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/code-5.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/code-5.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-5.png 1636w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">functions.py</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most annoying part was implementing <code>beq</code> and <code>bne</code>. Everything I fetch an instruction, I automatically increment the Program Counter, but MIPS reference card assumes that you don&apos;t increment it when you call <code>beq/bne</code>. I spent like 3 hours debugging this until I finally realized this. Ugh.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a MIPS Assembly Interpreter in Python" loading="lazy" width="1464" height="710" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/code-3.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/code-3.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-3.png 1464w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">functions.py</span></figcaption></figure><p>Writing <code>syscall</code> was also a little annoying because for some reason the data was in little endian format so I had read the hex bytes backwards, but then increment the memory address forward after reading each word.</p>
<h2 id="fetch">Fetch</h2><p>This part was pretty fun too. After running <code>spim -assemble [file].asm</code>, it gives you a binary with all the instructions and data in nice hex format. It looks somethign like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-asm">.text # 0x400024 .. 0x400044
.word 0x34080005, 0x34090007, 0x1285020, 0x34020001, 0x82021, 0xc, 0x3402000a, 0xc
.data # 0x10000000 .. 0x10010000
.word 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
</code></pre>
<p>Using Python magic, I parsed it and loaded all the instructions and data into an array. Whenever I want to access the data/instruction from it&apos;s actual memory address, I just subtract the start offset (first hex value after #) and divide by 4 to get the index in my array. For example:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a MIPS Assembly Interpreter in Python" loading="lazy" width="1066" height="368" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/code-6.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/code-6.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/02/code-6.png 1066w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">cpu.py</span></figcaption></figure><p>To fetch the next instruction, all we need to do it get the value in the array at <code>pc_idx()</code> and then increment <code>PC += 4</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>That&apos;s it! It was pretty fun building this interpreter. I think this was actually pretty similar to the Chip8 emulator tutorial that I never completed a few years ago. Anyways, lot&apos;s of cooler projects coming up, like a VR Duolingo game but it&apos;s a zombie outbreak and you have to talk in Chinese to survive.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment]]></title><description><![CDATA[During SBHacks 2025 we won best entertainment app with Baddy Buddy: Advanced Analytics for Badminton.]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/sbhacks-2025/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6788b3facbf46159506ddec1</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><category><![CDATA[Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 08:12:57 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-3.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-3.jpg" alt="SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment"><p>SBHacks11 happened during the first week of winter quarter.

We decided early on that we&apos;d make something related to badminton and AI, since our friend from Mountain View was actually a top 20 ranked player nationally!</p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3><p>We won 1st place in the entertainment track and you can see the results here.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://github.com/lce4113/baddy-buddy?ref=localhost"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">GitHub - lce4113/baddy-buddy</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Contribute to lce4113/baddy-buddy development by creating an account on GitHub.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/pinned-octocat-093da3e6fa40.svg" alt="SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">GitHub</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">lce4113</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://opengraph.githubassets.com/84d47b832c24ff3b5519a03811be1e369ebf3673b3e147363b121b1f360bcbd8/lce4113/baddy-buddy" alt="SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment"></div></a></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8pcAyOfyFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Baddy Buddy: Advanced Analytics for Badminton (SBHacks11 1st Place Entertainment Track)"></iframe></figure><h2 id="before-the-hackathon">Before the Hackathon</h2><p>Our planning phase was actually pretty tragic.

So at this point, we just stuck with cached results for the sample videos so that we didn&apos;t need to recompute.</p><h3 id="flask-backend">Flask Backend</h3><p>We mostly left the SoloShuttlePose repo intact (except for some bug fixes thanks to Omar), but we added our own Flask server to handle web requests for uploading and fetching data. This wasn&apos;t to hard, but if I remember correctly we ran into a bunch of problems with importing code from different folder structures (like from a submodule, for example), so we just invoked the python scripts on a subprocess. Actually, this is one of the main reasons SoloShuttlePose saved us; it bundled all three models into one project so we didn&apos;t need to manage three venvs and have imports all over the place. This is something I want to learn for the future; how to cleanly mix projects together in python.</p><h3 id="side-quests">Side Quests</h3><p>There were several mini games that we could compete in to win red tickets, which gave us a shot at the lottery for an electric scooter. I totally wanted that, so I participated in several of them, including a company talk, 1 AM push up contest, 3 AM yoga, and probably some more. We also tried doing a Smash Bros tournament but the wait was too long.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/3-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/3-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/3-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/3-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/3-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You can tell it&apos;s about 4 AM because the McDonald&apos;s DoorDash came at 3:30 AM</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="we-did-it">We...

We spent the rest of the time polishing this part up, as the demo is probably more important than the codebase itself. I also came up with a banger video idea and we filmed that. Unfortunately, the judges didn&apos;t even look at it because we had to do live demos. But hey, you can look at it... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8pcAyOfyFE&amp;ref=localhost">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8pcAyOfyFE</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment" loading="lazy" width="1582" height="1113" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-1.png 1582w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Fire video presentation</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then, somehow it was morning again. My body physically felt horrible, but I was excited for the judging to start.</p><h3 id="live-demo">Live Demo</h3><p>Our first judge was the Dean of Engineering. He loved badminton; not so much our app. We should&apos;ve told him that Ishan was top 20 in the nation, cuz that would&apos;ve sparked more conversation with him. He didn&apos;t even stick for our gen AI feature. Oh well, lesson learned&#x2014;we gotta be more efficient.</p><p>Next we had Prof. Matni. Super chill guy. He liked the presentation, and we executed well. In class the next day, he even told me that &quot;Baddy Buddy&quot; was a hot topic among the judges. Perhaps we could&apos;ve won one of the grand prizes if we had gotten a little luckier.</p><p>The last two were also better presentations, though the 3rd was for sure our best. The dude was so impressed with the vision model integrating with the gen AI model and asked so many questions, and we gave pretty good answers. Even the SBHack student admin who was with him was super impressed.</p><p>Overall, we gave good presentations that were an accurate representation of the work we did in the past 24 hours. Unlike some previous hackathons, we didn&apos;t sell.</p><h2 id="prize-time">Prize Time!</h2><p>I fell asleep during the judging period, but woke up just in time for the award ceremony. I had that same fever dream feeling that I had back at GunnHacks where I felt like the work I did was completely garbage and there was no way I could win anything. My team looked at each other knowing that we would probably not get prizes for our project.</p><p>BUT WE WERE WRONG: &quot;And the winner for our entertainment track is Baddy Buddy!&quot;</p><p>I was so excited. Even though it wasn&apos;t a particularly great prize, just the fact that our expectations were exceeded gave us the rush of happiness. Our hard work was validated.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SBHacks 2025: 1st Place Entertainment" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/image-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/image-2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-2.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Yuh</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="after-the-hackathon">After the Hackathon</h2><p>Afterwards, I ate lunch at DLG, did laundry, and passed out on my bed.

Not sure if anyone knows who we are, but it&apos;s still cool to be a little &quot;famous&quot; in the coding community. I even had someone go up to me and be like &quot;oh yeah, I think I saw you guys on Instagram.&quot; So that&apos;s fun.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DE0S58vyD0W/?ref=localhost">https://www.instagram.com/reel/DE0S58vyD0W/</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Anyway, after a tough loss at GunnHacks last year, it feels refreshing to win something.

I came home early from UCSB on my birthday because I didn&apos;t have any finals, so I basically had an extra week and a half of break. The early days of break were mostly spent playing poker and pickleball with my friends. There was one night where we slept over at Cheney&apos;s house and I made $170 playing PLO! I was running so hot that day, I think I had the absolute nuts 3 hands in a row at one point. And oh yeah, we played from 10pm-6am that night, which is basically a whole school day. (Another cool poker fact, we got to play in the Stanford dorms one day because one of Colin&apos;s friend lives there).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Christmas Break 24-25" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/image-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/image-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/01/image-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My $280 Wagyu and Lobster Birthday Dinner</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also visited Gunn for SEC and to see the basketball team. It was kinda awkward seeing Mr. Paley again because he was about to get on a call, and I didn&apos;t really say much when I got there. I had to go to leave for lunch so I didn&apos;t really get the chance to see how everything was going. I went out for lunch with Chris and Josh, and it was pretty interesting to see how everything was going for them, and I was especially curious what the culture was like at Cornell. It seems like they&apos;re both doing well; I need to get involved with my school a little more.</p><h2 id="singapore-and-thailand">Singapore and Thailand</h2><p>The highlight of the break was definitely seeing my little cousins in Singapore. It was so nice there&#x2014;even the subways had bidets! The airport had an indoor forest with a giant waterfall in the middle, and we even tried out some of the Michelin star restaurants there too. On the first night arriving, we went to the street market that was made famous from the <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> scene. I thought the food was good and unique, but not particularly special. The next day, we did a duck tour, which is like a boat and land vehicle that goes around Singapore; I got to see all the cool attractions like the Merlion and Apple&apos;s spherical Singapore store.</p><p>We also hung out in the mall quite a bit for food and shopping. My grandparents bought me some Birkenstocks, so that was really nice!</p><p>Once we went to Thailand, I was excited for the chance to relax by the pool/beach. The resort was pretty nice, it had a lazy river that looped around the entire place, and it wasn&apos;t too crowded. Nothing like Vidante though, that place was insane. But anyways, it was really nice to escape to this resort. We all got Thai massages where they walk on you. That night, I slept like a baby at 8:30pm.</p><p>The next day, we tried Muay Thai, which brought back memories of my Tae Kwon Do days. Kevin seems to have practiced a lot; my uncle wants me to take some classes here at UCSB this quarter.</p><p>Unfortunately, the trip was cut short by all the flying. I&apos;d say we only had about 4-5  full days because we had to fly back and forth so much. I wish we had more time because I really liked it there.</p><p>We also got to see my uncle&apos;s work building. It was on like the 40th floor of some super nice building and we enjoyed eating lunch there with the breathtaking view. I hope to work in a place like that someday.</p><p>That&apos;s basically it. I remember we also had some really good crabs that were famous in Singapore. The flight back was a few hours shorter so that was also really nice. I timed Oppenheimer on the plane so that the bomb would go off on New Years.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/5.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Christmas Break 24-25" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/5.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/5.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/5.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/5.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/4.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="Christmas Break 24-25" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/4.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/4.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/4.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/3.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Christmas Break 24-25" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/3.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/3.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/3.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/3.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/2.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Christmas Break 24-25" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/2.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Christmas Break 24-25" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/image.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/image.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2025/01/image.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="side-note-about-ping-pong-project">Side Note About Ping Pong Project</h2><p>Just before break I finished my ping pong project. Instead of keeping track of the score, I decided it would be cooler to recreate the scene in 3D. The process is mostly manual though, so it&apos;s not that practical. You can see a demo here:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_HpfIQpiJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="SLAM-TT: 3D Reconstruction of Table Tennis"></iframe></figure><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll continue, but if I do, it&apos;s actually really easy to change this into a point tracker, since all you need to know is where the last bounce on the table is to determine who wins.</p><h3 id="next-ccs-project">Next CCS Project</h3><p>I think I want to create a diffusion model that can help you preview different clothing items on your own body so that online shopping is easier and leads to less returns.

There are companies developing this technology, so I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s best to try creating a packaged product or just a recreation of the model to research purposes. The idea is to have a lightweight extension that would work on any shopping website, thus making the experience much better.</p><p>Or I can create a smart glasses app to look at poker and tell you the best move to make.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I had a great break.

Not that I&apos;m depressed or anything, just feel a little bored. Actually I&apos;m like really bored.</p><p>Because I joined CCS (which was confirmed earlier last week, yay!), my schedule changed so that I only have 3 classes. And none of them are real bro. Math has all exams online, with no midterms or finals. CCS 1A and 1L are not graded, and everything is self-paced. I have so much free time and I don&apos;t know what to do with it. Even my ping pong app is starting to get boring. I don&apos;t feel motivated to apply to more internships or research. I have 6 total hours of class a week, and no school on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.</p><p>Lately, I&apos;ve been playing video games to get over my boredom, but I feel icky afterward because I know that it&apos;s not the best way to spend my time. I just beat Sekiro yesterday; lowkey think that it was a little too easy but whatever.</p><p>But worst of all, I met this girl last week and I can&apos;t find the confidence to talk to her again. I told Mason my criteria for the perfect girl a few weeks ago, and she literally fits every description. Perhaps I like her for superficial reasons then, but I really can&apos;t tell. I saw her maybe about 4 times this week, still haven&apos;t talked to her again. I think this is the main reason for my slump. AHHH!!!!</p><p>Anyway, I just gotta be more confident and cheerful and all that. So yeah, good luck future me.</p><h3 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h3><p>I read that it&apos;s good to reflect on all the things I&apos;m grateful for. I&apos;m grateful that my parents were able to visit me last weekend; I had a lot of fun going out to eat and just talking about life back home. I think I&apos;ve forgotten a lot about my old self.</p><p>I&apos;m grateful for the friends I&apos;ve made so far in college, and also for the mentors at church. I&apos;m playing ping pong with Wesley on Friday, so looking forward to that.</p><p>I&apos;m grateful to be in CCS, there are a lot of cool things I&apos;m learning, and I&apos;m excited for next quarter&apos;s classes.

Those guys, however, use a two-step system to detect the ball; I want to do it faster so that we can run the app on a smart phone.</p><p>YOLO is currently in V11.

Right off the bat, however, there are a lot of problems to consider. First off, the ball can be hit at such high speeds that it would be impossible to capture precise movement data at 60fps. Also, you&apos;d have to position the camera to perfectly capture the entire table, which may not necessarily be possible in all scenarios.</p><h2 id="my-first-prototype">My First Prototype</h2><p>To combat these issues, I decided to track points in a simpler&#x2014;though less automated&#x2014;fashion. When a player wins a point, they simply raise their non-dominant hand to indicate that they&apos;ve won.</p><p>Though this approach is much more basic, I think it works better in practice, even if there&apos;s a way to track the ball accurately. Considering how many edge cases there are for deciding who wins a rally, it&apos;s probably better to let the human decide, rather than hope that the AI will guess correctly; using the hand-raise method ensures that the players always have control over the score, not letting there be any mistakes that they&apos;d have to manually override.</p><p>To test my idea, I built a quick prototype using Python and my Macbook webcam. The demo code uses OpenCV and Google&apos;s MediaPipe to detect the players and determine whether they&apos;ve raised their hand or not.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://github.com/ccs-cs1l-f24/ping-pong?ref=localhost"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">GitHub - ccs-cs1l-f24/ping-pong: Ping pong scoreboard using computer vision</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Ping pong scoreboard using computer vision.

When building previous Xcode projects, I had no idea what the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or MVC (Model-ViewController) architectures were, so I got confused when I&apos;d see so many different project formats. This time, however, I decided to learn one and stick with it. SwiftUI is a new framework that Apple recommends and uses the MVVM architecture, so I decided to go with that. It&apos;s actually pretty similar to React, where Views are like &quot;dumb&quot; components that render the props they&apos;re given, and ViewModels handle the backend logic. For MVC, ViewControllers are supposed to handle the logic and rendering at the same time, which can get messy.</p><p>Since SwiftUI is relatively newer and offers less control than UIKit (the previous framework), I spent most of my initial time trying to port Google&apos;s example iOS code for MediaPipe to work under SwiftUI. Luckily, the process wasn&apos;t that hard, as SwiftUI gives us a UIViewRepresentable class that allows you to run UIKit code in a SwiftUI app.</p><p>Once MediaPipe was set up, all I needed to do was write a callback function that processes the pose information, as seen below.</p><pre><code class="language-Swift">extension ScoreDetectionService: PoseLandmarkerServiceLiveStreamDelegate {
    func poseLandmarkerService(_ poseLandmarkerService: PoseLandmarkerService, didFinishDetection result: ResultBundle?, error: Error?) {
        // This delegate is called by the PoseLandmarkerService delegate, which processes data then gives it to us
        guard let poseLandmarkerResult = result?.poseLandmarkerResults.first as? PoseLandmarkerResult else { return }
        
        for playerLandmarks in poseLandmarkerResult.landmarks {
            // Extract useful pose landmarks
            let noseLandmark = playerLandmarks[0]
            let leftWristLandmark = playerLandmarks[15]
            let leftShoulderLandmark = playerLandmarks[11]
            
            // Check which side of screen
            let isLeftSide = noseLandmark.x &lt; 0.5
            
            // Check if raising hand
            let isRaisingHand = leftWristLandmark.y &gt;= leftShoulderLandmark.y
            
            // Pass it to the corresponding player side hand detection service
            if isLeftSide {
                self.leftSidePlayer.update(isRaisingHand: isRaisingHand)
            }
            else {
                self.rightSidePlayer.update(isRaisingHand: isRaisingHand)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function will detect which side the player is on and whether or not they are raising their hand. We then update the player state to see if they&apos;ve raised their hand long enough.</p><pre><code class="language-Swift">class PlayerHandDetectionService {
    var handRaised: Bool = false
    var handRaiseStartTime: Date = Date.distantFuture
    var handRaiseCounted = false
    
    var onPlayerWinsPoint: () -&gt; Void
    
    init(onPlayerWinsPoint: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {
        self.onPlayerWinsPoint = onPlayerWinsPoint
    }
    
    func update(isRaisingHand: Bool) {
        // TODO: If we&apos;ve been raising our hand long enough, give a point
        
        // Get current time
        let currentTime = Date()
        
        // If raising hand, check if we passed the threshold
        if isRaisingHand {
            // Just started raising our hand
            if !self.handRaised {
                self.handRaised = true
                self.handRaiseStartTime = currentTime
                self.handRaiseCounted = false
            }
            // We&apos;ve raised our hand long enough, give a point
            else if !self.handRaiseCounted &amp;&amp; currentTime.timeIntervalSince(self.handRaiseStartTime) &gt;= DefaultConstants.handRaiseDurationThreshold {
                self.onPlayerWinsPoint()
                self.handRaiseCounted = true
            }
        }
        // Else, reset hand check state
        else {
            self.handRaiseStartTime = Date.distantFuture

Someone on YouTube kind of got this working, so it&apos;s definitely possible.</li><li>Perhaps more interesting, I want to build an app that will &quot;transcribe&quot; the game into a full 3D reconstructed live scene, where the player can go back and analyze their form and see where they can improve. I&apos;ll do this by detecting where in space each item is at every frame, then rendering that into a 3D scene with something like Three.js or Unity.

The transition was really easy since I did a 6-week summer program beforehand, so I already had friends coming into school. So far, classes are super chill and I&apos;ve been attending as many club meetings as possible. I&apos;ve also done many things that I never would have expected before (more on this later).</p><p>Anyway, let&apos;s start at the beginning.</p><h2 id="freshman-summer-start-program">Freshman Summer Start Program</h2><p>Since this would be my first college experience, I was pretty nervous: there were so many new faces and I didn&apos;t have anyone I knew to hang out with. To make things worse, the building was really old (musty bathrooms, etc), so I had a bad feeling about how everything would turn out. I missed having my own private room and clean bathroom.</p><p>I really did not know what to do on that first night there, and I was kinda too scared to go out and say hi to people. So instead, I just played Sekiro on my M1 Macbook Pro. Probably not the best first impression when my roommate walked in for the first time. And not to glaze or anything, but he was a pretty intimidating guy: 6&apos;2, built, and with a really deep voice (emphasis on the deep voice, I mean like holy shit, I was trying to match my voice so I didn&apos;t sound like a little kid). Of course in hindsight, he&apos;s a cool dude, and it&apos;s kinda funny how scared I was in that moment when I first met him. Overall, my roommate was considerate of my space and was very clean; we got along well I think.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6002.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Starting College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_6002.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_6002.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_6002.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6002.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Very small room</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="new-friends-classes-and-fun-activities">New Friends, Classes, and Fun Activities</h3><p>The first few days were just for socializing and meeting new people. I think I made most of my friends by randomly sitting with them in the dining hall, or just complaining about the showers while passing by in the bathroom. To this day, I still hang out with those same people I met.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6278.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting College" loading="lazy" width="1177" height="1179" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_6278.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_6278.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6278.png 1177w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The FSSP squad</span></figcaption></figure><p>By the time classes started, I had a system for brushing my teeth and showering (which seems simple enough until you realize that the showers had no benches to put your stuff on). I ended up adopting the &quot;towel strat,&quot; where you would walk to the showers with only a towel on. It was awkward at first, but then again, what have I been training in the gym my whole life for!</p><p>The classes were pretty easy&#x2014;Writing 2 was self-graded and my Greek Myth TA gave everyone A&apos;s on their paper&#x2014;but I still spent a lot of time in the library. There&apos;s something kind of satisfying just grinding out homework while overlooking the ocean. I was studious for the first week or so, but then I started getting into Game of Thrones, and that took up most of my time instead.</p><p>Apart from class and the library, I&apos;d usually spend my time playing ping pong in the lounge (I was known as the best player in the building) or going to the gym. I actually got noticeably stronger in recent months, and I&apos;ve gotten some compliments about that from my friends.</p><p>Also, of course, I started surfing! My friend who was originally from Santa Cruz took us all out and taught us how to surf. I didn&apos;t stand that day, but I guess it led the path to many other fun surfing days. We went probably every week, especially since the beach was a 5-minute walk from our dorm and because we had unlimited access to boards and wetsuits.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_8931.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Starting College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_8931.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_8931.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_8931.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_8931.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First surf at Campus Point Beach</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="party-school">Party School?</h3><p>Once I found my place with my group of friends, we started going out every so often (they went out way more than me; I was trying to be a little more locked in). In Isla Vista, there are parties literally every day of the week. I remember going to one random frat house on a Thursday night (and keep in mind, this is the summer school) yet it was still packed with people.</p><p>Anyway, like I said in the introduction, I did something that I never thought I&apos;d do (perhaps regrettably). Actually, I think it was a bad idea. 5 shots was a little too many. I&apos;m not going to say it here but you (AKA future me) definitely know.

I missed my family and my friends, and I missed having good food. The first meal I ate when I got back was O2 Valley: BBQ pork over rice, popcorn chicken, and boba.  The classic combo!</p><p>I spent as much time as I could with my parents, but they also had to go to work. My day-to-day life was basically the same as before FSSP.</p><h3 id="berkeley">Berkeley</h3><p>I also had the chance to visit James and Cheney at Berkeley. Hayden and I took an Uber there (the train didn&apos;t work) and I slept over for two nights. We had a lot of fun trying new food, exploring the campus, and best of all, playing 7 hours of poker. I lost money, but oh well.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6249.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Starting College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_6249.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_6249.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_6249.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6249.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="shopping">Shopping</h3><p>When I got back on Monday, I met up with Josh, Max, and Mihlaan and went to Valley Fair mall.

Perhaps it was meant to be.</p><h3 id="zero-week-and-clubs">Zero Week and Clubs</h3><p>I met a lot of new people during zero week, and there were plenty of engineering events that I attended. Overall, this week was purely for making new friends and exploring what the university has to offer (a once-in-a-lifetime moment, just as Mr. Hahn predicted!). I should&apos;ve talked to more girls, but whatever; maybe after I get a perm and complete my ABB transformation I&apos;ll do that.</p><p>There were plenty of clubs that I was interested in: ACM, IEEE, Gaucho Racing, Game Dev Club, and UCSB Rocket Club. I only ended up joining ACM and IEEE though, since time is rough. I also checked out other events like the boba social from the Asian Engineering Club.</p><h3 id="church-is-really-good">Church is Really Good?</h3><p>Church has surprisingly been the highlight of many of my days. I first got started at A2F during the summer and met some of the mentors there&#x2014;all of them are amazing and really cool people. In particular, Joseph is a CS major from UCSB working remotely as a software engineer. We play basketball together and more recently, I&apos;ve been going with Surya to his house for Courses 101: delicious food and exploring hard questions about Christianity. His mom also taught Physics at Gunn; what a small world! There&apos;s another mentor named Dylan. He&apos;s a CE major who also works in the area, and he&apos;s really good at surfing. He brought his boards (he has six) the day after I moved in and took me surfing at Campus Point, which I thought was really nice of him. Derek is a software engineer from Berkeley who is also really cool. Eric is a 4th year CCS Physics major who is good at basketball and is probably going to grad school for CS (he said his research lab is looking for undergrads...). Cyril went to my high school! He did CS and is working in Santa Barbara; he knows Fuey&apos;s sister and Ethan Kitch&apos;s older brother. And finally, we have the pastor, John. Man, this guy is insane. He graduated EECS from Berkeley and went into software engineering, decided he didn&apos;t like it, took the LSAT and scored 99th percentile, decided that wasn&apos;t right either, scored 99th percentile on MCAT, then realized his true calling was to be a pastor. Wow. This guy is my inspiration for life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6331.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Starting College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_6331.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_6331.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_6331.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_6331.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_6332.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Starting College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_6332.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_6332.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_6332.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_6332.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Joseph&apos;s house</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, church has actually been the best networking &quot;club.&quot; But of course, I&apos;ve gotten much more than that from it.

As the year goes on, I hope to learn more about God and figure out who I&apos;m supposed to be.</p><p>Today, Surya (a non-Christian, but has been going for 2 weeks) and I took Mason to church. I was surprised to say that he really enjoyed it and even encouraged Beto to come. He doesn&apos;t believe in the God aspect of church, but he really relates to lessons about morality and purpose that we discussed this morning. Actually, off-topic, I think at church I saw Rori, someone from my middle school who I haven&apos;t seen in years. I wonder who else from Palo Alto goes here.</p><h3 id="a-new-major">A New Major?</h3><p>Finally, let&apos;s talk about about something that is HUGE for my college career. Last week, I got an email saying that I got into the College of Creative Studies! Now, though the name sounds a little lame, this is a really great opportunity. If you didn&apos;t read my blog post (&quot;Last Week of School&quot;) where I stressed out about applying for it, CCS is basically a &quot;graduate&quot; school for undergraduates. Basically, the idea is to accelerate lower div CS classes to push you straight into upper div as soon as possible. By Spring, I&apos;ll be taking upper div CS courses.</p><p>Not only is the program accelerated, but there are other perks. Best of all, perhaps, is that being in CCS greatly increases chances of getting research, because the professors know that we&apos;re the real deal. The class size is also really small, so you can make a close connection with your peers and with your professors (this year is only 5 people in CCS Computing, though generally there are about 15 per year). Some of my classmates are quite strange, but I think it&apos;ll be fine. My friend Ezra from Gunn is also one of the 5 in this program.</p><p>My offer into this major is actually contingent on my performance in the first class. Professor Richert Wang told me that if I&apos;m not done with the CS 24 labs by the end of week 5, I could be in some trouble. It&apos;s been 4 days since he told me that; I finished all of it. Looking forward to finishing CS 32 this week!</p><p>For my CCS Lab, I&apos;m working on an AI ping-pong scoreboard app that can automatically track points. My first approach is to detect when a player raises their hands to indicate that they&apos;ve won the rally. Soon, I could look into actual automation, but I think the hand-raise approach works better in practice.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccs-cs1l-f24/ping-pong/refs/heads/main/public/demo.png" class="kg-image" alt="Starting College" loading="lazy" width="2880" height="1800"></figure><p>I&apos;ve also started applying to research and internships, now that I have the CCS badge under my name.

I loved it. The food was really good, the mountains and beaches were really pretty, and people were very friendly. The only downside is that the last two Airbnb&apos;s smelled really bad (especially in the bathroom), and there were lots of drug dealers out on the streets at night time (although it was interesting to see people try selling cocaine to us).</p><h3 id="lisbon">Lisbon</h3><p>We spent the first five days in Lisbon, where we explored the city, tried all sorts of new food, and looked at some castles. The Airbnb was really nice, though it was located more on the outside of the city, where all the business buildings were. We were really tired the first night, so we just walked to the nearest restaurant, which served burgers that looked and tasted like cat food. Not fun.</p><p>We spent our first real day trying out different foods in the city. The bifanas and the pastel de natas were really good, so we made sure to get more when we visited other places. We also tried margaritas for the first time!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg" width="1537" height="2049" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg 1537w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It doesn&apos;t look super fancy, but it tastes SOOO good</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>We&apos;d usually get back around 10-11 pm, just in time for some late-night poker.

We came in with about $25 each and lost it all in a matter of 20 seconds&#x2014;three hands of blackjack. It took us longer to walk from the entrance to the table than to actually play the game.

We started by seeing the castle and a famous well. It was cool, but it wasn&apos;t anything spectacular in my opinion. What really stood out was the hike we did right after. Since it was starting to rain a little, all the other tourists left, meaning the mountain was all to ourselves. And on top of that, there was mist everywhere around us (it looked so cool).</p><p>I also bought a souvenir shirt here. Turns out, when I went to buy my parents a gift on the last night of the trip, I accidentally bought the exact same shirt without realizing.

The entire atmosphere of the place was kinda cool too, with menu items like &quot;Vegan bitch&quot; and other interesting names.</p><p>But the food wasn&apos;t the best part, it was the beach! We did a boat tour, went on Kayaks, and chilled by the ocean, sipping our Pi&#xF1;a Coladas.

some time preparing for college. I met with Al a few times at the Mitchell Park Library to talk about UCSB and photonics stuff. The first meeting was mostly about his &quot;Start UC&quot; program that he wants to start with me, but I told him that I wanted to wait until I settled into college before taking on this big project. In our second meeting, he was super eager to teach me about photonics, a topic which I told him I was interested in (because of its applications in Artificial Intelligence). I learned about phonons, photons, conduction bands, indirect/direct gaps, P-N junction, and so much more in that one hour. To be honest, I don&apos;t understand everything, but it still is super interesting.</p><h3 id="elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring DLC: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3><p>I&apos;ve been waiting for months and I finally got the chance to play. I had so much fun, but I might&apos;ve spent a little too much time stuck in my room. I beat the DLC in about 40 hours, which was over the course of 12-ish days. There&apos;s so much lore to uncover it&apos;s actually unbelievable. And the final boss was incredibly satisfying to beat.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/Sunset.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Summer Before College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Sunset.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Sunset.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Sunset.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/Sunset.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It&apos;s beautiful</span></figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="getting-a-job">Getting a &quot;Job&quot;</h3><p>My mom wanted me to get a job this summer so that I could &quot;learn the value of money&quot; and all that fun stuff. So I signed up to be a DoorDasher, got in my car, and waited... and waited... and kept waiting for two hours and still got no orders. What a total waste of time! I tried three more days before giving up on it completely.</p><p>Instead, my parents were willing to hire me instead. I did some basic housework like gardening, installing a new sprinkler control panel, and other cleaning tasks. I made $15 an hour, so not the best, but also not horrible either.</p><p>My mom started talking to church friends about my search for work, and that led to more side job opportunities. I started by cleaning Mrs. Angela&apos;s shed and made $60 for 2.5 hours. I think it looks really clean!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Summer Before College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It used to be completely filled with spiderwebs</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, I started a little basketball clinic for June and Johann&apos;s kids. I think they really enjoyed it. We did basic dribbling drills, shooting, and some fun games like dribble knockout. Kevin and Evelyn joined for a few sessions two and had fun.</p><p>I made about $90 for 5 hours, but it was also nice talking to June and Johann about college/career/life stuff afterward. They recommended I take some stats classes and learn the technologies that engineers actually use in industry, rather than just the theory. I think I&apos;m going to take that into account when I pick courses in two days. On the final day, the kids and the parents wrote me thank you notes, with June and Johann strongly suggesting that I join a Christian group in college.</p><h3 id="kevin-and-evelyn">Kevin and Evelyn</h3><p>My little cousins are back! It was super fun hanging out with them this past week and a half. Kevin is getting alarmingly tall (99.7th percentile), but I still have some time before he surpasses me. The week went by really quickly, but we spent time playing late-night board games, Smash Bros, JCC basketball, and watching Brooklyn 99. We also went to the Hillsdale Mall to shop (Kevin bought a Harry Potter game), and we went again later that week to do an escape room. I think everyone had a really great time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Lot&apos;s of fun with our little cousins</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>But today will be the last time we&apos;ll see them for a few months.

There&apos;s basically no work to do and my grades are locked in already, so there&apos;s really nothing that&apos;s hard. I finally stopped making that stupid sandwhich that I always each for lunch (everyday Sophomore year) and now I go out to each during 2nd period photo or skipping a few classes.</p><p>In terms of coding projects, there&apos;s not much activity there to be honest. I&apos;m still learning more about AI, and it&apos;ll be a while before I can make some real projects (I&apos;d rather make something technically complex than another boring app). For my Calc final, I made a script to record chords and decompose it into the individual notes using Fourrier Transform. This concept is pretty cool and has a lot of applications; I saw it at Atmosic but I was never really sure what it did (or what frequency domain meant). My CS Capstone final is likely a quick script to turn a song into an image, and have a script to play a song from an image.</p><h3 id="college-stuff">College Stuff</h3><p>I finally had all my recommendation letters and videos sent to UCSB CCS Computing, which is the &quot;graduate&quot; CS school for undergrads. It gives you a much more personalized experience and focuses on performing research alongside regular coursework. It&apos;s pretty competitive; people have given up Stanford and Berkeley to get into this, even though I never heard of this before.</p><p>Fuey recenlty got off the waitlist for UCSB and I&apos;ve been trying my best to convince him to come. I don&apos;t understand the thought-process of going with UIUC&#x2014;to me, it just seems like a worse school at a worse location, but I guess it has the specific major that he wants to do.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.pacbiztimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ucsb-campus-storke-bike-circle-ucen-ocean.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Last Week of School" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It&apos;s like a beach resort...</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3 id="prom-and-ditch-day">Prom and Ditch Day</h3><p>Prom was pretty fun. I went with my usual group of friends and we took some pictures at Bol Park. After-party was fun too.</p><p>Ditch day was awesome. We went to Poplar Beach and walked like 15 minutes down the coast into an isolated part of the beach (where no one else would find us). There were probably a little under a hundred seniors there sleeping over in tents. Some people started a bonfire and there were games like volleyball and spikeball.</p><p>I think everyone was probably drunk or high, but that made it really easy to socialize and just talk to people I don&apos;t normally talk to. Hayden threw up in the tent, which made me really paranoid the whole night. Luckily, the tent didn&apos;t smell and nothing else happened.</p><p>I think in the middle of the night, some Paly kids were on top of the cliff throwing eggs at all of us. A few hit the tent and a few got on my jacket, but I don&apos;t think anyone was in the right headspace to care at all.</p><p>Some of us were in the &quot;bijillionth dimension,&quot; while others were only in the 5th dimension lol. It was pretty funny listening to people talk.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Last Week of School" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Last Week of School" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ditch Day at Poplar Beach</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>A few days later, a news article appears online: &quot;Gunn High School trashes Poplar Beach&quot;.

For the last 10 or so people in Senior Assassin, we used Life360 to track each other&apos;s locations. I saw that Fuey was right outside of Ella&apos;s house (to get Mihlaan, who was there too), and so I asked if I could wait with him. We waited and did some driving, and he tells me that there&apos;s a faster way: Shree can get us into the house since he&apos;s good friends with them. Turns out, Fuey knew that Shree had me, but still it was the only way he could get in. So I guessed he sacrificed me so that he could get his target. Wow.</p><p>A week or so later, we&apos;re hanging out at the Y, and we decide to go for his other target, Julia. We wait outside her house for a while, but then we see her parked outside of Safeway. Easy kill, we think. When we got there, the windows were open, and Julia looks at us as if she was waiting for us to come. Then, out of nowhere, McKayla pops out of the back seat and shoots Fuey as he approaches. We totally got outplayed there. I guess we were too obviously waiting outside her house, so she decided to lure us out and kill Fuey.</p><p>Anyways, Fuey complained that McKayla didn&apos;t have her location on, so the kill got reversed. He survived this round, and eventually, ended up winning the entire thing. He made $400.</p><h3 id="upcoming-stuff">Upcoming Stuff</h3><p>Wow, my last day of school was last week. I literally can&apos;t believe it; I really enjoyed PAUSD. The graduation ceremony is in a few days, and after that, my friends and I are headed straight to Portugal. No plans for the trip yet, but we have all of our housing and transportation booked. Other than that, I signed up to be a DoorDash driver (my parents wanted me to get a job and this seems the easiest), but I also just sent an application to In-N-Out since they pay way more.</p><p>I&apos;m really excited for college. Hopefully I get a double with a great roommate and I can bring my gaming PC. I also want to do some morning runs by the beach, as well as lots of gym days. I think it&apos;ll be really fun.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m looking forward to all the grad parties. At the one with our close family friends, I got a few really good books. I&apos;ve already read &quot;Atomic Habits&quot; and &quot;How To Win Friends and Influence People,&quot; but I&apos;m looking forward to reading &quot;I Will Teach You To Be Rich&quot; over the summer. Stay posted for some book summaries!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Hard Thing About Hard Things]]></title><description><![CDATA[Book notes on "The Hard Thing About Hard Things"]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6542dd3495dd5467248acbe4</guid><category><![CDATA[Book Notes]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 03:57:18 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_4720.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_4720.jpg" alt="The Hard Thing About Hard Things"><p>This is one of my favorite and most relatable books. Not only does he have similar feelings about his high school and company (as a football player and being stressed out all the time), but he also begins each chapter with a rap! This guy is so cool. I wrote about him and his book in my Stanford essays.</p><p>To be honest, I read this book 6 months ago and have book slacking off on my book summaries. Also, during my Stanford interview, Yinan asked me specific questions about the book (cuz I told him it inspired me), but I couldn&apos;t answer them lol. </p><p>Anyway, based on my notes and what I remember, this is what&apos;s important.</p><ul><li>Firing is hard emotionally, but if someone doesn&apos;t fit your culture or is not doing what is required/expected, fire them immediately</li><li>Firing should not be a surprise, but you should take care of them. Leave a good impression for future employees and create good working conditions</li><li>In layoffs, the CEO should clearly state that it&apos;s the company&apos;s fault.</li><li>CEO is a lonely job: no one else has all the information; you can&apos;t share the burden by taking the &quot;accepted&quot; answer from other employees because the company will die; no one is born a CEO and must experience failure to succeed later on</li><li>Take care of your people first, then your shareholders</li><li>When deciding equity, everyone should be just a little unsatisfied; that&apos;s how you know you&apos;ve done it right</li><li>Be honest. People see through fake positivity, and it actually makes you look stupid. If you&apos;re in trouble, say so</li><li>Bad news spreads automatically, so there&apos;s no point in trying to cover it up. Surprises destroy employee&apos;s trust in leadership and hurts morale</li><li>Take care of HR, because taking care of employees is the only way to create a great company; more important than the product or profit themselves</li><li>Spend time investing in employee training. It may take a while at first, but in the long run, it&apos;s worth it (saving a little time multiplied by 365 days a year)</li><li>One-on-one meetings are very important, and they should not be forced. Managers should do 85% listening and less talking. If there&apos;s a problem, employees need a way to communicate that privately and safely</li><li>Nobody cares. It doesn&apos;t matter if you fail with a great reason; spend all your energy finding the one impossible solution (also in sports psychology speech by Mr. Creighton)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
