So I guess I&apos;ll try summarizing my entire summer in this one blog post.</p><h2 id="senior-grad-tripportugal">Senior Grad Trip - Portugal</h2><p>My friends and I just got back from our senior trip in Portugal a few weeks ago. I loved it. The food was really good, the mountains and beaches were really pretty, and people were very friendly. The only downside is that the last two Airbnb&apos;s smelled really bad (especially in the bathroom), and there were lots of drug dealers out on the streets at night time (although it was interesting to see people try selling cocaine to us).</p><h3 id="lisbon">Lisbon</h3><p>We spent the first five days in Lisbon, where we explored the city, tried all sorts of new food, and looked at some castles. The Airbnb was really nice, though it was located more on the outside of the city, where all the business buildings were. We were really tired the first night, so we just walked to the nearest restaurant, which served burgers that looked and tasted like cat food. Not fun.</p><p>We spent our first real day trying out different foods in the city. The bifanas and the pastel de natas were really good, so we made sure to get more when we visited other places. We also tried margaritas for the first time!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg" width="1537" height="2049" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_0922-2.jpg 1537w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5458-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5093-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It doesn&apos;t look super fancy, but it tastes SOOO good</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>We&apos;d usually get back around 10-11 pm, just in time for some late-night poker. In the first few games, I profited about $110, though that number slowly dwindled down to somewhere around $60 by the end of the trip.

That was pretty fun, but everyone around us was smoking so I guess not that fun.</p><p>On the last night before we left Lisbon, we also hit the casino. We came in with about $25 each and lost it all in a matter of 20 seconds&#x2014;three hands of blackjack. It took us longer to walk from the entrance to the table than to actually play the game. I guess that&apos;s why no one looked happy there (although we saw one woman cash out $10,000).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5422.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5422.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5422.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5422.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5422.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5905-1.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5905-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5905-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5905-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5905-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5254-1.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5254-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5254-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5254-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5254-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="sintra">Sintra</h3><p>This was probably the most beautiful place I&apos;ve ever seen. We started by seeing the castle and a famous well. It was cool, but it wasn&apos;t anything spectacular in my opinion. What really stood out was the hike we did right after. Since it was starting to rain a little, all the other tourists left, meaning the mountain was all to ourselves. And on top of that, there was mist everywhere around us (it looked so cool).</p><p>I also bought a souvenir shirt here. Turns out, when I went to buy my parents a gift on the last night of the trip, I accidentally bought the exact same shirt without realizing. I don&apos;t know how that happened.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5396-2.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5396-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5396-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5396-2.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_1071-3.jpg" width="1537" height="2049" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_1071-3.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_1071-3.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_1071-3.jpg 1537w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_6062-2.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_6062-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_6062-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_6062-2.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5355-1.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5355-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5355-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5355-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="lagosluz">Lagos/Luz</h3><p>Even though Lisbon and Sintra were really pretty, I think the highlight of the trip was Lagos. It&apos;s a small beach town with lots of really good food. My personal favorite was the restaurant where I got sushi as an appetizer and steak for my main course. The entire atmosphere of the place was kinda cool too, with menu items like &quot;Vegan bitch&quot; and other interesting names.</p><p>But the food wasn&apos;t the best part, it was the beach! We did a boat tour, went on Kayaks, and chilled by the ocean, sipping our Pi&#xF1;a Coladas. We even started a Jetski rental an hour before our bus back to Lisbon.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5642-2.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5642-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5642-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5642-2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5642-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5637-1.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5637-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5637-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5637-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5637-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5635-2.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5635-2.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5635-2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5635-2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5635-2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5652.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5652.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5652.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5652.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5652.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5686.jpg" width="1536" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5686.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5686.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5686.jpg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_1359-1.jpg" width="1537" height="2049" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_1359-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_1359-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_1359-1.jpg 1537w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><h3 id="overall-thoughts">Overall Thoughts</h3><p>Even though I really wanted to go to Japan, I think this trip exceeded my expectations.

some time preparing for college. I met with Al a few times at the Mitchell Park Library to talk about UCSB and photonics stuff. The first meeting was mostly about his &quot;Start UC&quot; program that he wants to start with me, but I told him that I wanted to wait until I settled into college before taking on this big project. In our second meeting, he was super eager to teach me about photonics, a topic which I told him I was interested in (because of its applications in Artificial Intelligence). I learned about phonons, photons, conduction bands, indirect/direct gaps, P-N junction, and so much more in that one hour. To be honest, I don&apos;t understand everything, but it still is super interesting.</p><h3 id="elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring DLC: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3><p>I&apos;ve been waiting for months and I finally got the chance to play. I had so much fun, but I might&apos;ve spent a little too much time stuck in my room. I beat the DLC in about 40 hours, which was over the course of 12-ish days. There&apos;s so much lore to uncover it&apos;s actually unbelievable. And the final boss was incredibly satisfying to beat.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/Sunset.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Summer Before College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Sunset.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Sunset.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Sunset.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/Sunset.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It&apos;s beautiful</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="getting-a-job">Getting a &quot;Job&quot;</h3><p>My mom wanted me to get a job this summer so that I could &quot;learn the value of money&quot; and all that fun stuff. So I signed up to be a DoorDasher, got in my car, and waited... and waited... and kept waiting for two hours and still got no orders. What a total waste of time! I tried three more days before giving up on it completely.</p><p>Instead, my parents were willing to hire me instead. I did some basic housework like gardening, installing a new sprinkler control panel, and other cleaning tasks. I made $15 an hour, so not the best, but also not horrible either.</p><p>My mom started talking to church friends about my search for work, and that led to more side job opportunities. I started by cleaning Mrs. Angela&apos;s shed and made $60 for 2.5 hours. I think it looks really clean!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Summer Before College" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/08/IMG_5747.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It used to be completely filled with spiderwebs</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, I started a little basketball clinic for June and Johann&apos;s kids. I think they really enjoyed it. We did basic dribbling drills, shooting, and some fun games like dribble knockout. Kevin and Evelyn joined for a few sessions two and had fun.</p><p>I made about $90 for 5 hours, but it was also nice talking to June and Johann about college/career/life stuff afterward. They recommended I take some stats classes and learn the technologies that engineers actually use in industry, rather than just the theory. I think I&apos;m going to take that into account when I pick courses in two days. On the final day, the kids and the parents wrote me thank you notes, with June and Johann strongly suggesting that I join a Christian group in college.</p><h3 id="kevin-and-evelyn">Kevin and Evelyn</h3><p>My little cousins are back! It was super fun hanging out with them this past week and a half. Kevin is getting alarmingly tall (99.7th percentile), but I still have some time before he surpasses me. The week went by really quickly, but we spent time playing late-night board games, Smash Bros, JCC basketball, and watching Brooklyn 99. We also went to the Hillsdale Mall to shop (Kevin bought a Harry Potter game), and we went again later that week to do an escape room. I think everyone had a really great time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5828.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5817.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5771.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5807.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5844.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5845.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5848.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="The Summer Before College" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/IMG_5762-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Lot&apos;s of fun with our little cousins</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>But today will be the last time we&apos;ll see them for a few months.

There&apos;s basically no work to do and my grades are locked in already, so there&apos;s really nothing that&apos;s hard. I finally stopped making that stupid sandwhich that I always each for lunch (everyday Sophomore year) and now I go out to each during 2nd period photo or skipping a few classes.</p><p>In terms of coding projects, there&apos;s not much activity there to be honest. I&apos;m still learning more about AI, and it&apos;ll be a while before I can make some real projects (I&apos;d rather make something technically complex than another boring app). For my Calc final, I made a script to record chords and decompose it into the individual notes using Fourrier Transform. This concept is pretty cool and has a lot of applications; I saw it at Atmosic but I was never really sure what it did (or what frequency domain mean&apos;t). My CS Capstone final is likely a quick script to turn a song into an image, and have a script to play a song from an image.</p><h3 id="college-stuff">College Stuff</h3><p>I finally had all my recommendation letters and videos sent to UCSB CCS Computing, which is the &quot;graduate&quot; CS school for undergrads. It gives you a much more personalized experience and focuses on performing research alongside regular coursework. It&apos;s pretty competitive; people have given up Stanford and Berkeley to get into this, even though I never heard of this before.</p><p>Fuey recenlty got off the waitlist for UCSB and I&apos;ve been trying my best to convince him to come. I don&apos;t understand the thought-process of going with UIUC&#x2014;to me, it just seems like a worse school at a worse location, but I guess it has the specific major that he wants to do.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.pacbiztimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ucsb-campus-storke-bike-circle-ucen-ocean.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Last Week of School" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It&apos;s like a beach resort...</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><h3 id="prom-and-ditch-day">Prom and Ditch Day</h3><p>Prom was pretty fun. I went with my usual group of friends and we took some pictures at Bol Park. After-party was fun too.</p><p>Ditch day was awesome. We went to Poplar Beach and walked like 15 minutes down the coast into an isolated part of the beach (where no one else would find us). There were probably a little under a hundred seniors there sleeping over in tents. Some people started a bonfire and there were games like volleyball and spikeball.</p><p>I think everyone was probably drunk or high, but that made it really easy to socialize and just talk to people I don&apos;t normally talk to. Hayden threw up in the tent, which made me really paranoid the whole night. Luckily, the tent didn&apos;t smell and nothing else happened.</p><p>I think in the middle of the night, some Paly kids were on top of the cliff throwing eggs at all of us. A few hit the tent and a few got on my jacket, but I don&apos;t think anyone was in the right headspace to care at all.</p><p>Some of us were in the &quot;bijillionth dimension,&quot; while others were only in the 5th dimension lol. It was pretty funny listening to people talk.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Last Week of School" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/IMG_4936.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="Last Week of School" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/05/IMG_4937.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ditch Day at Poplar Beach</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>A few days later, a news article appears online: &quot;Gunn High School trashes Poplar Beach&quot;. Uh oh.</p><p>Basically, it was resolved with a really nice &quot;sorry&quot; letter and some volunteer effort by our Seniors to clean up all the trash and more.</p><h3 id="senior-assassin">Senior Assassin</h3><p>I can&apos;t believe I was betrayed. For the last 10 or so people in Senior Assassin, we used Life360 to track each other&apos;s locations. I saw that Fuey was right outside of Ella&apos;s house (to get Mihlaan, who was there too), and so I asked if I could wait with him. We waited and did some driving, and he tells me that there&apos;s a faster way: Shree can get us into the house since he&apos;s good friends with them. Turns out, Fuey knew that Shree had me, but still it was the only way he could get in. So I guessed he sacrificed me so that he could get his target. Wow.</p><p>A week or so later, we&apos;re hanging out at the Y, and we decide to go for his other target, Julia. We wait outside her house for a while, but then we see her parked outside of Safeway. Easy kill, we think. When we got there, the windows were open, and Julia looks at us as if she was waiting for us to come. Then, out of nowhere, McKayla pops out of the back seat and shoots Fuey as he approaches. We totally got outplayed there. I guess we were too obviously waiting outside her house, so she decided to lure us out and kill Fuey.</p><p>Anyways, Fuey complained that McKayla didn&apos;t have her location on, so the kill got reversed. He survived this round, and eventually, ended up winning the entire thing. He made $400.</p><h3 id="upcoming-stuff">Upcoming Stuff</h3><p>Wow, my last day of school was last week. I literally can&apos;t believe it; I really enjoyed PAUSD. The graduation ceremony is in a few days, and after that, my friends and I are headed straight to Portugal. No plans for the trip yet, but we have all of our housing and transportation booked. Other than that, I signed up to be a DoorDash driver (my parents wanted me to get a job and this seems the easiest), but I also just sent an application to In-N-Out since they pay way more.</p><p>I&apos;m really excited for college. Hopefully I get a double with a great roommate and I can bring my gaming PC. I also want to do some morning runs by the beach, as well as lots of gym days. I think it&apos;ll be really fun.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m looking forward to all the grad parties. At the one with our close family friends, I got a few really good books. I&apos;ve already read &quot;Atomic Habits&quot; and &quot;How To Win Friends and Influence People,&quot; but I&apos;m looking forward to reading &quot;I Will Teach You To Be Rich&quot; over the summer. Stay posted for some book summaries!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Hard Thing About Hard Things]]></title><description><![CDATA[Book notes on "The Hard Thing About Hard Things"]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6542dd3495dd5467248acbe4</guid><category><![CDATA[Book Notes]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 03:57:18 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_4720.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_4720.jpg" alt="The Hard Thing About Hard Things"><p>This is one of my favorite and most relatable books. Not only does he have similar feelings about his high school and company (as a football player and being stressed out all the time), but he also begins each chapter with a rap! This guy is so cool. I wrote about him and his book in my Stanford essays.</p><p>To be honest, I read this book 6 months ago and have book slacking off on my book summaries. Also, during my Stanford interview, Yinan asked me specific questions about the book (cuz I told him it inspired me), but I couldn&apos;t answer them lol. </p><p>Anyway, based on my notes and what I remember, this is what&apos;s important.</p><ul><li>Firing is hard emotionally, but if someone doesn&apos;t fit your culture or is not doing what is required/expected, fire them immediately</li><li>Firing should not be a surprise, but you should take care of them. Leave a good impression for future employees and create good working conditions</li><li>In layoffs, the CEO should clearly state that it&apos;s the company&apos;s fault.</li><li>CEO is a lonely job: no one else has all the information; you can&apos;t share the burden by taking the &quot;accepted&quot; answer from other employees because the company will die; no one is born a CEO and must experience failure to succeed later on</li><li>Take care of your people first, then your shareholders</li><li>When deciding equity, everyone should be just a little unsatisfied; that&apos;s how you know you&apos;ve done it right</li><li>Be honest. People see through fake positivity, and it actually makes you look stupid. If you&apos;re in trouble, say so</li><li>Bad news spreads automatically, so there&apos;s no point in trying to cover it up. Surprises destroy employee&apos;s trust in leadership and hurts morale</li><li>Take care of HR, because taking care of employees is the only way to create a great company; more important than the product or profit themselves</li><li>Spend time investing in employee training. It may take a while at first, but in the long run, it&apos;s worth it (saving a little time multiplied by 365 days a year)</li><li>One-on-one meetings are very important, and they should not be forced. Managers should do 85% listening and less talking. If there&apos;s a problem, employees need a way to communicate that privately and safely</li><li>Nobody cares. It doesn&apos;t matter if you fail with a great reason; spend all your energy finding the one impossible solution (also in sports psychology speech by Mr. Creighton)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fall In Love With the Problem, Not the Solution]]></title><description><![CDATA[Book notes on "Fall in Love With the Problem, Not the Solution"]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/fall-in-love-with-the-problem-not-the-solution/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64cb29716272e0524c0f4c1e</guid><category><![CDATA[Book Notes]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 03:57:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3712.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3712.jpg" alt="Fall In Love With the Problem, Not the Solution"><p>I&apos;ve given up on writing full-blown summaries. I read this book like a year ago and these notes have just been sitting here.</p><ul><li>If you&apos;re not willing to give up a sport or a hobby, you&apos;re not dedicated enough to run a startup. Your investors will not be dedicated enough either</li><li>Starting with the problem will give you a clear message to tell people and they&apos;ll understand it better, rather than &quot;our system does...&quot;</li><li>If the problem is something daily, you&apos;re onto something (we like the &quot;toothbrush model&quot; &#x2013; twice a day</li><li>Fail fast. If you aren&apos;t willing to fail, you already did</li><li>The main thing is the main thing; focus all of your energy on your current phase (fundraising, R&amp;D, etc)</li><li>Find investors that will stick with you through tough times and will support you. Prepare to dance the &quot;hundred noes&quot;</li><li>Fire fast. &quot;Knowing what you know today, would you hire this person? If not, fire them the next day&quot;</li><li>Elite teammates will know when someone is out of place. They will leave if you don&apos;t fire the bad ones</li><li>It is okay to fire a cofounder, and sometimes necessary. Don&apos;t expect to still be friends though</li><li>Users don&apos;t like change. The early majority need to be convinced to join, and will churn unless they get immediate value</li><li>You are a one-man sample; don&apos;t expect your assumptions to hold true with everyone</li><li>People who find value will share it with others. Don&apos;t expect a user to read anything you provide them</li><li>If  you cannot figure out PMF, you will die</li><li>Figure out your business model: B2C (prefer don&apos;t make them pay upfront, either sell advertising data or go with subscription), B2B, or B2B SaaS (the best, which allows you to get steady annual income)</li><li>Set the price on the value you create, not on what it costs you to make. If that isn&apos;t profitable, change your business model</li><li>Word of mouth works best for high-frequency apps because people have more opportunities to tell someone else</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[College Decisions]]></title><description><![CDATA[College sucks... kinda.]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/college-decisions/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66176ef6d65e55689084b7be</guid><category><![CDATA[Random]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 05:47:30 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/04/iStock-155441000.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/04/iStock-155441000.jpg" alt="College Decisions"><p>I&apos;m gonna be completely honest, I&apos;m pretty sad. I see my friends and classmates get into their dream schools like Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, and all that, while I&apos;m here scrolling through Reddit for comments like &quot;it&apos;s okay, college rank doesn&apos;t <em>actually </em>matter.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t say that my results were the worst-case scenario&#x2014;unlike my friend who got rejected from all 25 CS schools he applied to (except ASU), I have a few solid choices to choose from. But still, it just feels unsatisfying. I&apos;ve always dreamt of getting into Stanford, opening the decision letter with my parents, and then running across my street screaming &quot;Oh my God!!!&quot;</p><p>I guess that&apos;ll never happen.</p><h3 id="whats-next">What&apos;s Next?</h3><p>Right now, I think my top two options are UT Austin and UCSB. My dilemma is this: UT&apos;s engineering program looks really fun, the buildings are super cool looking, and it has a decent reputation. But at the same time, it&apos;s Texas... 90% Texans to be exact. I have no clue whether I&apos;d fit in, and the area just seems to foreign to what I&apos;m used to.</p><p>UCSB, on the other hand, seems like a dream school, but it doesn&apos;t really have the reputation to make me go &quot;Wow I&apos;m so excited.&quot; I know that rankings aren&apos;t everything, but it does hurt a little bit thinking about how just 4 months ago, my family totally dismissed that as an option because it&apos;s a &quot;party school.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m visiting this Saturday and I&apos;ve emailed an old classmate who does engineering there, so I have some things to look forward to at UCSB, but this decision is just killing me!</p><p>Put simply, if I want a more comfortable experience at a smaller engineering program, go to UCSB. If I care about prestige and don&apos;t mind being across the country at a big school, go to UT Austin.</p><p>Some side things to consider are also that UCSB will let me switch to CS if I want, and I have the option of doing a 5-year master&apos;s degree. UT Austin locks me into Cockrell, so no CS classes (other than those provided in the certificate program). Also, no football at UCSB, and the startup scene is probably less vibrant.</p><h3 id="in-the-meantime">In the meantime</h3><p>But in the meantime, there are still 6 weeks of senior year to enjoy. I definitely did not start a business like planned, but that&apos;s lowkey still on the table if I get an idea and put in the effort.</p><p>My last adult league basketball game is tomorrow as well, but it was really fun while it lasted. I&apos;ve made great memories at our post-game dinners and poker sleepovers.</p><p>I&apos;m also really interested in AI all of a sudden. I started reading a few books and watching some Stanford AI courses; I&apos;m thinking of starting a small project pretty soon as well. If things go well with my dad&apos;s networking, an OpenAI internship would actually be so fire.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I&apos;m gonna be completely honest, I&apos;m really jealous of a lot of people at my school, especially the people who can just apply to Stanford for the hell of it and get in (of course, they&apos;ve already committed to MIT). I&apos;ve always thought I was like that, but I guess this is a good shift in perspective. I&apos;ll need to work my ass off if I want to get my dream job or pursue grad school; no more letting my pride be an excuse for laziness.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunn Elimination Recap]]></title><description><![CDATA[The final entry of my Gunn Elimination blog series]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/gunn-elimination-blog-3/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65b89028d0e6474374318b26</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 07:09:24 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_9651.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_9651.JPG" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap"><p>I&apos;ve totally been slacking off on my blogging, but let&apos;s try to do this before I forget everything.</p><p>Elimination ended eight days ago, but it feels much longer than that. I think it&apos;s because the kills really started to die down at the end since it&apos;s really hard to kill a tryhard. This is the final standings, with Liam Wong winning the game.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="1459" height="1138" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image-1.png 1459w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Final Standings</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="managing-the-game">Managing the Game</h2><p>There were a few road bumps here and there, but the game went pretty smoothy overall. Someone even said, and I quote, that it was an &quot;honor to meet the CEO of Elimination.&quot; That felt really good.</p><h3 id="forgetting-to-click-save">Forgetting to click save</h3><p>Somehow, I forgot to click save when I disabled Supabase signups, so over 50 new users signed up on the first day. That was problematic because I was getting reports of people not having targets, and it checked out on the database. This had me panicking, and so I manually set their targets (this is while simultaneously handing out plushies at lunch, and holding my own plushie to be safe).</p><p>Luckily, a friend texted about wanting to sign up but not be in the game. That&apos;s when I was really surprised because she shouldn&apos;t have been able to sign up in the first place, and I realized that it was because I didn&apos;t click save (but because of this, I was able to smuggle James into the game without anyone noticing).</p><h3 id="lots-of-freaking-emails">Lots of freaking emails</h3><p>Let&apos;s say 2% of the population are little bitches and complain about getting killed without reading the rules (and these Gunn people really love to write elaborate, long essays to defend their stupidity). For the first few days, that&apos;s like 14 emails a day, which is totally unmanageable. I sent a message on the first day saying that I would no longer be &quot;reviving&quot; players and that they should read all rules before giving their codes. It got a lot better.</p><p>Still, I was getting like 5 emails a day, which is fine but just annoying when I have to make a judgment on each edge case while trying my best to make sure they aren&apos;t lying. I gave up on responding to emails about a week.</p><h3 id="i-hate-freshman">I hate freshman</h3><p>Not only did these freshmen have the nerve to find Matchomatics data on my GitHub and call it &quot;hacking,&quot; but they also decided to brute-force elimination codes. I really did not think this would be an issue, and I really did not want to implement rate-limiting or some penalty (I&apos;m a very trusting and lazy person I guess). But I guess that kinda backfired.</p><p>The freshman who did it actually succeeded after about 6 hours, which not only led to a bunch of frantic emails but also totally increased my server costs. Look at the number of API requests below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="635" height="501" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/image-14.png 635w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I&apos;m famous guys!</span></figcaption></figure><p>I thought I was running some million-dollar corporation for a second.</p><p>I ended up being nice about it, since he emailed me an apology letter explaining how he did it and why. I told him that he could implement rate-limiting for next year&apos;s Elimination.</p><h3 id="the-interviews">The interviews</h3><p>Apparently, I&apos;m not a great interviewer. I had very little to say, and when Oracle released their news article I was very scarcely quoted (and I was saying some stupid stuff too). I guess I&apos;ll work on that for the future.</p><p>Some kid even interviewed me for her English project, but that&apos;s like totally a waste of my time bro.</p><h2 id="some-final-elimination-stories">Some Final Elimination Stories</h2><p>Last year, I&apos;d say my craziest story is when a very dedicated Senior tried to eliminate me. He followed me outside of CS Capstone and tagged me right when I left the N-building stairs; but when I looked up, I still had the roof over me. I then sprinted across to the little theater, weaved through the overhangs to try making it to basketball practice, and asked Sangeet to get my stuff from my car. Luckily, the roof connected all the way to Titan Gym, so I was good for now.</p><p>When practice ended, my car was the only one in the parking lot, except for the a suspiciously parked truck next to me. Some guy came out and was like, &quot;yo can you jump my car, I think it died,&quot; and I was a little suspicious (but more trusting because my car also died last week too). Suddenly, the guy popped out, I dropped all my stuff, and I bolted back to Bow Gym where there was an overhang. I guess we were in a little stalemate, with him trying to follow me every step I took, and his friends lurking around my car. But somehow, I outmaneuvered him at the last second and sprinted to the car, he might&apos;ve tagged me in the car, but it didn&apos;t matter since the car has a roof too.</p><p>He was persistent though, and he got his friends to stand in front and behind my car, preventing me from driving off. We were there for almost 30 minutes, and he was like &quot;yeah I have nothing better to do so we can do this all day.&quot; Some of his friends drove over too.</p><p>Eventually, I just got tired, and I told him I was letting go of my brakes. And I did. And he moved, but shocked at the idea that I would run him over to escape. When I cleared them, he tried sprinting along side my car, but I accelerated and I was gone.</p><h3 id="someones-little-brother">Someone&apos;s little brother</h3><p>Bro, I&apos;m not gonna write much since I&apos;m getting tired, but if you know I have my plushie in my hand, and you try looking at my from an angle where you can&apos;t see it, of course that doesn&apos;t count. That&apos;s what Nathan&apos;s little brother tried doing and it pissed me off. The worse part is that he&apos;s a freshman and he felt so entitled, saying shit like &quot;oh you had your fun coding the site, so the other players should be able to have their fun and you&apos;re preventing that by not following the rules.&quot; Like bro I wrote the rules, and you&apos;re literally stupid.</p><p>Anyway, later that night I stayed to shoot an hour after practice. When I went out, he popped out behind my car and tagged me, but I was prepared and was holding my plushie. Yay.</p><h3 id="a-betrayal-of-sorts">A betrayal of sorts</h3><p>I reshuffled targets at Cheney&apos;s house, after our big Paly game win, and my new target was Ethan Zhou. I feel kinda bad, cuz he was trying to help me with the site (even though it was too late), and spent all night making this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="1908" height="985" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/image.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image.png 1908w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ethan Zhou&apos;s homepage</span></figcaption></figure><p>It looks pretty cool, but it would be too hard to integrate that style for the entire site, and make it work for mobile.</p><p>But anyways, I was stupid enough to tell Steve and Chloe that I had him, so they instantly warned him. Steve was too scared to lead me to Ethan during lunch, so we wandered campus for the entire lunch. I didn&apos;t find him, until after math, I saw him at the little theater. The theater is it&apos;s own island, so there&apos;s no wall connecting to the N-building (which is where he had English). Surely, this meant victory.</p><p>But he was persistent and just waited there, thinking that he could outlast me. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/04/IMG_9894.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/IMG_9894.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/IMG_9894.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/IMG_9894.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/04/IMG_9894.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Waiting patiently to get my kill</span></figcaption></figure><p>After 15 minutes, and after his friend brought out the assignment for him, he dropped his plushie to grab a pencil. I immediately capitalized on the opportunity and got the kill.</p><h3 id="a-trip-to-grt">A trip to GRT</h3><p>I definitely shouldn&apos;t have made eye contact with Vivian, and definitely should not have been so obvious when trying to tag her. She immediately sat down, so she was safe, and I had to come back later that night to get her during GRT.</p><p>After practice, James and I got some Zareens, then went back to Gunn. It&apos;s like 9:30 PM at this point, so GRT should be getting out. But someone saw me and snitched, so now the entire GRT is teaming up to try to get Vivian to safety while I&apos;m just waiting for the opportunity to tag her.</p><p>I sit while they take their meeting, and it&apos;s been like 30 minutes. Some dude spills lychee jelly on my head, then offers me $60 to leave. Of course, I said no because first of all, he&apos;s definitely not giving me $60, and secondly, I don&apos;t want his money.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/04/IMG_4590.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/IMG_4590.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/IMG_4590.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/IMG_4590.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/04/IMG_4590.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">GRT Meeting</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it&apos;s over, she slides all they way to the back parking lot into her mom&apos;s car, and at the last moment when she needs to stand up, five GRT kids shove me.

Sprints are all about working with your team to quickly go from planning to prototyping, to live user interactions, and using them can help speed up hard business decisions.

They can help you avoid things like waiting 6 months before realizing Bluetooth doesn&apos;t work (hmmm I wonder who did that...). Sprints are used in several companies and have led to incredibly cool products (like AirBnB).</p><p>Also, a sprint is requires 5 full days of undivided attention.

Where do we want to be six months, a year, or even five years from now?&quot;</p><h3 id="uncover-underlying-assumptions-morning">Uncover Underlying Assumptions (morning)</h3><p>When creating your goal, you were probably quite optimistic about the future. But there are dangerous assumptions that you took to get there. The next step is to turn each assumption into a question, which you will then be answering by the end of the sprint. Think about the following:</p><ul><li>What questions do we want to answer in this sprint?</li><li>To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true?</li><li>Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused this?</li></ul><h3 id="create-a-map">Create a Map</h3><p>The map will show your customers moving through every step of your service or product and will help you narrow your broad challenge into a specific goal later on.

Information is asymmetrically distributed across the company, and you&apos;ll need people who can pick up on easily missed details.</p><p>Here&apos;s who to talk to:</p><p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Talk with the &quot;Decider&quot; about questions like &quot;What will make this project a success&quot;, &quot;What&apos;s our unique advantage or opportunity&quot;, and &quot;What&apos;s the biggest risk&quot;</p><p><strong>Voice of the Customer: </strong>Find the person who knows the customer the best and can explain their perspective</p><p><strong>How Things Word:</strong> Who best understands the mechanics of your product? How does everything fit together?</p><p><strong>Previous Efforts: </strong>Sometimes, people already thought about a similar problem and may have some experience with attempting to solve them.</p><h3 id="how-might-we">How Might We</h3><p>While listening to the experts, note any interesting concepts and create a &quot;How Might We&quot; note on a Post-it. These are questions that could be interesting to solve, like &quot;HMW - Structure key info for screening patients?&quot;. Write in big markets so it forces you to be concise, and so that it can be seen easily.</p><ol><li>Write a &quot;How Might We&quot; on a Post-it by yourself</li><li>Stick it onto a wall when everyone is done</li><li>Vote silently with sticker &quot;dots&quot;. Each person gets two dots, while the Decider gets four dots.</li><li>Select the ones with multiple votes and use those targets to guide the rest of the sprint</li></ol><h3 id="pick-the-target">Pick the Target</h3><p>The final task for Monday is to choose the target for your sprint. Who is the most important customer, and what is the most critical experience for them? The &quot;How Might We&quot; notes can often make this decision obvious, but the Decider is always the one who gets the final say&#x2013;this is the biggest opportunity to do something great.</p><p>If the decider wants help, use a straw poll. Everyone should write their vote on a piece of paper, and after the votes are tallied, there should be a discussion on any big differences in opinion. The decider can now make their call.</p><p>Now that you have identified a long-term goal and question to answer, everyone will be ready for the next step: it&apos;s time to come up with some solutions.</p><h2 id="tuesday-sketch">Tuesday: Sketch</h2><p>Not gonna lie, I wrote everything above about 4 months ago, and I don&apos;t remember the book in as much depth.</p><p>The goal for this day is to generate a wide range of potential solutions. You start by reviewing what you did yesterday, and then each person will individually <em>sketch</em>, following a four-step process: notes, ideas, crazy 8s, and solution sketch.</p><ol><li><strong>Notes: </strong>Have the team walk around the room and take notes to refresh their memories before committing to a solution. Feel free to research specific details from the company&apos;s own product. This takes about twenty minutes, and then spend three minutes at the end reviewing everything.</li><li><strong>Ideas: </strong>Jot rough ideas, fill a sheet of paper with doodles, diagrams, stick figures, etc. Take twenty minutes with this and then review at the end for three minutes.</li><li><strong>Crazy 8s: </strong>Each person takes their strongest ideas and rapidly sketches eight variations in eight minutes. This promotes potential breakthroughs.</li><li><strong>Solution Sketch: </strong>Sketch a three-panel of the final solution to be looked at and judged by others. It&apos;s the final sketch!</li></ol><h2 id="wednesday-decide">Wednesday: Decide</h2><p>Today you&apos;ll evaluate ideas and decide on the solution that will be prototyped. There&apos;s a five-step process.</p><ol><li><strong>Art museum:</strong> Put the solution sketches on the wall with masking tape</li><li><strong>Heat map: </strong>Look at all the solutions in silence, and use dot stickers to mark interesting parts</li><li><strong>Speed critique: </strong>Quickly discuss the highlights of each solution, and use sticky notes to capture big ideas</li><li><strong>Straw poll: </strong>Each person chooses one solution, and votes for it with a dot sticker</li><li><strong>Supervote: </strong>The Decider makes the final decision, with more stickers!</li></ol><h2 id="thursday-prototype">Thursday: Prototype</h2><p>Now it&apos;s time to build a prototype that can be tested with real users. It&apos;s much more effective and easier to fake it rather than build the real thing. It&apos;ll emulate what your product will actually do, without needing the complex implementation and lack of polish.</p><p>Here&apos;s one way to do this.</p><ol><li><strong>Pick the right tools: </strong>Often, your usual tools are too slow. Use something like Apple&apos;s Keynote that can mimic what you want quickly. I&apos;d probably use Figma.</li><li><strong>Divide and conquer: </strong>Makers will create individual components, while Stitchers will put them together. Writers make the content reasonable (we <em>hate</em> lorem ipsum).</li><li><strong>Stich it together: </strong>Make sure fake content is consistent throughout the app</li><li><strong>Do a trial run: </strong>Do it around 3pm to give you enough time to fix it.</li></ol><h2 id="friday-test">Friday: Test</h2><p>Now it&apos;s time to learn from watching/interviewing users. There should generally be around five interviewees.</p><p>Here&apos;s how you should run them.</p><ol><li><strong>Friendly welcome: </strong>People need to feel comfortable to be honest and open, so start with something like &quot;Thanks for coming in today! Your feedback is really important to us&quot;</li><li><strong>Context questions:</strong> Ask about the customer&apos;s background so you get a better idea on who they are and how they&apos;d user your product</li><li><strong>Introduce the prototype:</strong> &quot;Would you like to see the prototype? I didn&apos;t design it so I won&apos;t be hurt by your feedback. Also think aloud!&quot;</li><li><strong>Tasks and nudges: </strong>&quot;What do you expect that will do? What is this for?&quot;. Just gauge their reactions.</li><li><strong>Quick debrief: </strong>&quot;How does this product compare to what you do now? What did you wish was different?&quot;</li></ol><p>In general, you should be watching these interviews together and taking notes as a team (on a giant whiteboard). Look for patterns in reactions and see if they answer the questions you came up with on Monday.</p><p>The best part is that you can&apos;t lose. Either you&apos;re on the right track, or you only spent five days exploring a tangent.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Now you can go test your ideas quickly! I won&apos;t use this for a while since I don&apos;t have a startup nor do I have a huge team. But what I do have is a Stanford interview tomorrow, so I&apos;m going to sleep now and then I&apos;ll have a great time talking with this guy!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunn Matchomatics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Disrupting a (potentially) million-dollar company in two days.

All of these matches (along with identifying data such as name, gender, grade) are flattened into an array and stored in a new <code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>To find the match-compatibility score, we can use Dylan Lu&apos;s magical love-matching algorithm. We give &quot;points&quot; for questions that are answered the same or very closely, and we give extra points for matching &quot;dependent&quot; questions (for example, I answered that I prefer girls with brown hair, and a girl answered they have brown hair).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/code-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Matchomatics" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="1552" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/code-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/code-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/code-1.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/code-1.png 1628w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dylan Lu&apos;s Magical Love-Matching Algorithm</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that we&apos;ve matched everyone, we&apos;ll need to convert the outputted <code>.csv</code> file into something printable and pretty.

<p>The <code>template.html</code> file is basically a giant wrapper that includes the basic boilerplate HTML needed and brings in Tailwind. We take all our data and pass it to a new <code>person.html</code>, which presents it in a pretty page format.</p>

I was a little skeptical&#x2014;<em>when was the last time he hung out with a college friend in California?</em>  <em>and why can&apos;t he get an Uber?</em>&#x2014;but I decided it wasn&apos;t that big of a deal. Then we got there, and I saw who it actually was: my little cousins, aunt, and uncle!</p><p>I missed my little cousins and aunt and uncle, so I was really excited and surprised to see them make a last-minute trip all the way from Beijing. My grandparents, on the other hand, burst out in tears. The whole family was together, and everyone was happy.</p><h2 id="before-christmas">Before Christmas</h2><p>I&apos;m not gonna lie, I left my Econ final an hour early because I was incredibly unmotivated to continue the test. I then played Elden Ring for 3 hours when I got home.</p><p>Speaking of Elden Ring, that&apos;s what I did literally all day for the next days, because I was super sad about <em>something.</em></p><p>But then I got over it. And I started writing my college apps again.</p><h2 id="christmas">Christmas</h2><p>Even though my parents made it absolutely clear that we would not get any gifts this year (the iPhone for our birthdays was good enough!), they called my sister and I down in the morning, and I got a 2TB SSD drive! I was genuinely excited, and it felt good knowing that my dad cared enough to surprise me with something I actually wanted.</p><p>My uncle (Yen Yen) got me cologne. I never thought about using cologne before, but, in my uncle&apos;s words, it&apos;s time for me to be a man now. So I started to wear it every day, and I think it smells pretty good!</p><p>Best of all, I now had enough Christmas + Birthday money to buy my latest toy: the iPad Pro. Why? Because now I can write all my notes digitally, and I can use it as a second monitor for my Macbook at school. My dad said that was a very gimmicky reason to drop $1k, but as they say, &quot;spend a lot on things you care about, but really save when it&apos;s something else.&quot; I&apos;m paraphrasing and I don&apos;t remember where I read it, but you get the point. Of course, that also meant I spent money on a &quot;paper&quot; screen protector with a special Apple pencil tip, and a really snug magnetic case/stand.</p><p>But now that I have an iPad Pro (and have joined the &quot;Macbook Pro, iPhone Pro, Airpods Pro, and iPad Pro&quot; family), I actually use it for things I&apos;d never thought I would. First off, my dad bought a recipe-making app, so I&apos;m learning to cook with it. I&apos;ve made chicken quesadillas so far (which are <em>so </em>good), and I&apos;m moving my way up to steak eventually. My dad also has Procreate, which is a drawing app. I&apos;m doing this thing where I draw a little bit (almost) everyday, and then see where I end up in a year/several months. Right now, I&apos;m drawing things from Zelda, Dragon Ball Z, and Elden Ring, and I&apos;ll hopefully get better as I progress.</p><p>To end Christmas, the whole family sang, I played violin (after not touching it for 6+ years), Jocelyn played clarinet, and Evelyn and Kevin played piano. Wai Po also gave us a math challenge for $100, and of course, I won it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/08/IMG_4448-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/IMG_4448-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/IMG_4448-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/IMG_4448-1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/08/IMG_4448-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I&apos;m a Pro</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1470" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First Quesadilla</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-day-after">The Day After</h2><p>We went to Ruby Hill to eat lunch and play golf with Tyler Wong&apos;s family.

I was just thinking about how much stuff gets done in the first few months of school starting, which is why I pushed back my MIT application so I can have more time to write about them. Tomorrow is exactly one year after my last golf game with Dave, Ray, Bryan, and Grandpa at Ruby Hill, which is when I also asked Dave if he could help me with my LunchTrak project. Tomorrow is also the day I am meeting with Vypin&apos;s CEO to talk about potentially partnering up to deliver this LunchTrak solution for realsies. I&apos;m so scared, but I&apos;m excited; if everything goes well in the long term, I can definitely see myself getting 5% royalty on $100K a month. That&apos;s a life-changing amount of money.</p><p>It&apos;s also homecoming this week, which is crazy since it&apos;s the last one I&apos;ll ever have.

The difference is that anyone can play and that instead of water guns, we use plushies. Also, there are different rules every day to be &quot;safe&quot;, ranging from easy things like holding the plushie to harder ones like being under a roof.</p><h2 id="developing-elimination">Developing Elimination</h2><p>I decided to learn <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/?ref=localhost">SvelteKit</a> because it&apos;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship?ref=localhost">Fireship&apos;s</a> favorite framework, and I chose Supabase because I had a little experience with it and it&apos;s incredibly easy.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://github.com/gunn-elimination/elimination-2024?ref=localhost"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">GitHub - gunn-elimination/elimination-2024: Frontend for Elimination 2024</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Frontend for Elimination 2024.

I had a design initially, but I think it looks pretty ugly:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/09/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Blog #1" loading="lazy" width="1327" height="684" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/09/image.png 1327w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ugly Elimination</figcaption></figure><p>I read <a href="https://www.refactoringui.com/?ref=localhost">Refactoring UI</a> and transformed it into this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/09/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Blog #1" loading="lazy" width="744" height="373" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/09/image-1.png 744w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A Little Better I think</figcaption></figure><p>The updated version includes many of the techniques listed in the book, including:</p><ul><li>More whitespace everywhere</li><li>Use overlapping layers to provide depth</li><li>Tint background image when there&apos;s text on it</li><li>Use accent color strip to look more &quot;designed&quot; (see the blue strip?)</li><li>Shadows provide depth, use them on cards, modals, buttons, etc</li><li>Don&apos;t do white text on a colored button.

I will write a blog post on Refactoring UI eventually.</p><h2 id="supabase-is-amazing">Supabase is Amazing</h2><p>If it had a more generous free tier, I&apos;d probably use it for every project (it&apos;s limited to 2 active projects, which pause after 7 days).

I chose Google OAuth because all PAUSD students have a Google Workspace email, which I can use to get their name and student ID. It also verifies that they are a student and not a random person.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/09/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Blog #1" loading="lazy" width="607" height="342" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/09/image-2.png 607w"><figcaption>Google OAuth</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Look how easy the code is!

No more being lazy, no more being scared to take calls, no more avoiding people. Today, after my college counselor meeting with Ms. Ross, I called up Eric from Vypin. He suggested that we partner and use his prebuilt Bluetooth solution. My initial thoughts are that it could be good, but I&apos;m not so sure about how expensive it will be, how long the battery will last, and how big it will be. In these aspects, I think my design wins, but it clearly is not reliable.</p><p>And, I finally sent an email to Dave asking for a recommendation letter, something I&apos;ve put off for almost 2 months now (I have zero confidence in myself sometimes).
