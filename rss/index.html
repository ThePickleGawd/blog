I see my friends and classmates get into their dream schools like Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, and all that, while I&apos;m here scrolling through Reddit for comments like &quot;it&apos;s okay, college rank doesn&apos;t <em>actually </em>matter.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t say that my results were the worst-case scenario&#x2014;unlike my friend who got rejected from all 25 CS schools he applied to (except ASU), I have a few solid choices to choose from. But still, it just feels unsatisfying. I&apos;ve always dreamt of getting into Stanford, opening the decision letter with my parents, and then running across my street screaming &quot;Oh my God!!!&quot;</p><p>I guess that&apos;ll never happen.</p><h3 id="whats-next">What&apos;s Next?</h3><p>Right now, I think my top two options are UT Austin and UCSB. My dilemma is this: UT&apos;s engineering program looks really fun, the buildings are super cool looking, and it has a decent reputation. But at the same time, it&apos;s Texas... 90% Texans to be exact. I have no clue whether I&apos;d fit in, and the area just seems to foreign to what I&apos;m used to.</p><p>UCSB, on the other hand, seems like a dream school, but it doesn&apos;t really have the reputation to make me go &quot;Wow I&apos;m so excited.&quot; I know that rankings aren&apos;t everything, but it does hurt a little bit thinking about how just 4 months ago, my family totally dismissed that as an option because it&apos;s a &quot;party school.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m visiting this Saturday and I&apos;ve emailed an old classmate who does engineering there, so I have some things to look forward to at UCSB, but this decision is just killing me!</p><p>Put simply, if I want a more comfortable experience at a smaller engineering program, go to UCSB. If I care about prestige and don&apos;t mind being across the country at a big school, go to UT Austin.</p><p>Some side things to consider are also that UCSB will let me switch to CS if I want, and I have the option of doing a 5-year master&apos;s degree. UT Austin locks me into Cockrell, so no CS classes (other than those provided in the certificate program). Also, no football at UCSB, and the startup scene is probably less vibrant.</p><h3 id="in-the-meantime">In the meantime</h3><p>But in the meantime, there are still 6 weeks of senior year to enjoy. I definitely did not start a business like planned, but that&apos;s lowkey still on the table if I get an idea and put in the effort.</p><p>My last adult league basketball game is tomorrow as well, but it was really fun while it lasted. I&apos;ve made great memories at our post-game dinners and poker sleepovers.</p><p>I&apos;m also really interested in AI all of a sudden. I started reading a few books and watching some Stanford AI courses; I&apos;m thinking of starting a small project pretty soon as well. If things go well with my dad&apos;s networking, an OpenAI internship would actually be so fire.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I&apos;m gonna be completely honest, I&apos;m really jealous of a lot of people at my school, especially the people who can just apply to Stanford for the hell of it and get in (of course, they&apos;ve already committed to MIT). I&apos;ve always thought I was like that, but I guess this is a good shift in perspective. I&apos;ll need to work my ass off if I want to get my dream job or pursue grad school; no more letting my pride be an excuse for laziness.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunn Elimination Recap]]></title><description><![CDATA[The final entry of my Gunn Elimination blog series]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/gunn-elimination-blog-3/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65b89028d0e6474374318b26</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 07:09:24 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_9651.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/IMG_9651.JPG" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap"><p>I&apos;ve totally been slacking off on my blogging, but let&apos;s try to do this before I forget everything.</p><p>Elimination ended eight days ago, but it feels much longer than that. I think it&apos;s because the kills really started to die down at the end since it&apos;s really hard to kill a tryhard. This is the final standings, with Liam Wong winning the game.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="1459" height="1138" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image-1.png 1459w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Final Standings</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="managing-the-game">Managing the Game</h2><p>There were a few road bumps here and there, but the game went pretty smoothy overall. Someone even said, and I quote, that it was an &quot;honor to meet the CEO of Elimination.&quot; That felt really good.</p><h3 id="forgetting-to-click-save">Forgetting to click save</h3><p>Somehow, I forgot to click save when I disabled Supabase signups, so over 50 new users signed up on the first day. That was problematic because I was getting reports of people not having targets, and it checked out on the database. This had me panicking, and so I manually set their targets (this is while simultaneously handing out plushies at lunch, and holding my own plushie to be safe).</p><p>Luckily, a friend texted about wanting to sign up but not be in the game. That&apos;s when I was really surprised because she shouldn&apos;t have been able to sign up in the first place, and I realized that it was because I didn&apos;t click save (but because of this, I was able to smuggle James into the game without anyone noticing).</p><h3 id="lots-of-freaking-emails">Lots of freaking emails</h3><p>Let&apos;s say 2% of the population are little bitches and complain about getting killed without reading the rules (and these Gunn people really love to write elaborate, long essays to defend their stupidity). For the first few days, that&apos;s like 14 emails a day, which is totally unmanageable. I sent a message on the first day saying that I would no longer be &quot;reviving&quot; players and that they should read all rules before giving their codes. It got a lot better.</p><p>Still, I was getting like 5 emails a day, which is fine but just annoying when I have to make a judgment on each edge case while trying my best to make sure they aren&apos;t lying. I gave up on responding to emails about a week.</p><h3 id="i-hate-freshman">I hate freshman</h3><p>Not only did these freshmen have the nerve to find Matchomatics data on my GitHub and call it &quot;hacking,&quot; but they also decided to brute-force elimination codes. I really did not think this would be an issue, and I really did not want to implement rate-limiting or some penalty (I&apos;m a very trusting and lazy person I guess). But I guess that kinda backfired.</p><p>The freshman who did it actually succeeded after about 6 hours, which not only led to a bunch of frantic emails but also totally increased my server costs. Look at the number of API requests below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="635" height="501" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/image-14.png 635w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I&apos;m famous guys!</span></figcaption></figure><p>I thought I was running some million-dollar corporation for a second.</p><p>I ended up being nice about it, since he emailed me an apology letter explaining how he did it and why. I told him that he could implement rate-limiting for next year&apos;s Elimination.</p><h3 id="the-interviews">The interviews</h3><p>Apparently, I&apos;m not a great interviewer. I had very little to say, and when Oracle released their news article I was very scarcely quoted (and I was saying some stupid stuff too). I guess I&apos;ll work on that for the future.</p><p>Some kid even interviewed me for her English project, but that&apos;s like totally a waste of my time bro.</p><h2 id="some-final-elimination-stories">Some Final Elimination Stories</h2><p>Last year, I&apos;d say my craziest story is when a very dedicated Senior tried to eliminate me. He followed me outside of CS Capstone and tagged me right when I left the N-building stairs; but when I looked up, I still had the roof over me. I then sprinted across to the little theater, weaved through the overhangs to try making it to basketball practice, and asked Sangeet to get my stuff from my car. Luckily, the roof connected all the way to Titan Gym, so I was good for now.</p><p>When practice ended, my car was the only one in the parking lot, except for the a suspiciously parked truck next to me. Some guy came out and was like, &quot;yo can you jump my car, I think it died,&quot; and I was a little suspicious (but more trusting because my car also died last week too). Suddenly, the guy popped out, I dropped all my stuff, and I bolted back to Bow Gym where there was an overhang. I guess we were in a little stalemate, with him trying to follow me every step I took, and his friends lurking around my car. But somehow, I outmaneuvered him at the last second and sprinted to the car, he might&apos;ve tagged me in the car, but it didn&apos;t matter since the car has a roof too.</p><p>He was persistent though, and he got his friends to stand in front and behind my car, preventing me from driving off. We were there for almost 30 minutes, and he was like &quot;yeah I have nothing better to do so we can do this all day.&quot; Some of his friends drove over too.</p><p>Eventually, I just got tired, and I told him I was letting go of my brakes. And I did. And he moved, but shocked at the idea that I would run him over to escape. When I cleared them, he tried sprinting along side my car, but I accelerated and I was gone.</p><h3 id="someones-little-brother">Someone&apos;s little brother</h3><p>Bro, I&apos;m not gonna write much since I&apos;m getting tired, but if you know I have my plushie in my hand, and you try looking at my from an angle where you can&apos;t see it, of course that doesn&apos;t count. That&apos;s what Nathan&apos;s little brother tried doing and it pissed me off. The worse part is that he&apos;s a freshman and he felt so entitled, saying shit like &quot;oh you had your fun coding the site, so the other players should be able to have their fun and you&apos;re preventing that by not following the rules.&quot; Like bro I wrote the rules, and you&apos;re literally stupid.</p><p>Anyway, later that night I stayed to shoot an hour after practice. When I went out, he popped out behind my car and tagged me, but I was prepared and was holding my plushie. Yay.</p><h3 id="a-betrayal-of-sorts">A betrayal of sorts</h3><p>I reshuffled targets at Cheney&apos;s house, after our big Paly game win, and my new target was Ethan Zhou. I feel kinda bad, cuz he was trying to help me with the site (even though it was too late), and spent all night making this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy" width="1908" height="985" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/image.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/image.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/image.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/02/image.png 1908w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ethan Zhou&apos;s homepage</span></figcaption></figure><p>It looks pretty cool, but it would be too hard to integrate that style for the entire site, and make it work for mobile.</p><p>But anyways, I was stupid enough to tell Steve and Chloe that I had him, so they instantly warned him. Steve was too scared to lead me to Ethan during lunch, so we wandered campus for the entire lunch. I didn&apos;t find him, until after math, I saw him at the little theater. The theater is it&apos;s own island, so there&apos;s no wall connecting to the N-building (which is where he had English). Surely, this meant victory.</p><p>But he was persistent and just waited there, thinking that he could outlast me. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765256670149345290/1212654121832808468/IMG_9894.jpg?ex=65f29f28&amp;is=65e02a28&amp;hm=d6df7cbcf12b69ceea645dbc40e0de0e6739a68bcef2f5cc75cdb957c2e324fa&amp;" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Waiting patiently to get my kill</span></figcaption></figure><p>After 15 minutes, and after his friend brought out the assignment for him, he dropped his plushie to grab a pencil.

She immediately sat down, so she was safe, and I had to come back later that night to get her during GRT.</p><p>After practice, James and I got some Zareens, then went back to Gunn. It&apos;s like 9:30 PM at this point, so GRT should be getting out. But someone saw me and snitched, so now the entire GRT is teaming up to try to get Vivian to safety while I&apos;m just waiting for the opportunity to tag her.</p><p>I sit while they take their meeting, and it&apos;s been like 30 minutes. Some dude spills lychee jelly on my head, then offers me $60 to leave. Of course, I said no because first of all, he&apos;s definitely not giving me $60, and secondly, I don&apos;t want his money.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765256670149345290/1212652935893352448/IMG_4590.jpg?ex=65f29e0d&amp;is=65e0290d&amp;hm=e0e8c4bcbacf35f69becc6c5c0685607787fcbbcd761fffa6950713bbd49c1f1&amp;" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Elimination Recap" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">GRT Meeting</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it&apos;s over, she slides all they way to the back parking lot into her mom&apos;s car, and at the last moment when she needs to stand up, five GRT kids shove me.

Sprints are all about working with your team to quickly go from planning to prototyping, to live user interactions, and using them can help speed up hard business decisions. You won&apos;t need a polished product, just something convincing enough for your tester (even an interactive Figma could work).</p><h2 id="when-and-why-sprint">When and Why Sprint?</h2><p>Use sprints when you need to answer an urgent question about your business, product, or customers. They can help you avoid things like waiting 6 months before realizing Bluetooth doesn&apos;t work (hmmm I wonder who did that...). Sprints are used in several companies and have led to incredibly cool products (like AirBnB).</p><p>Also, a sprint is requires 5 full days of undivided attention. If you can&apos;t form a team that can go through this process, it won&apos;t be as effective.</p><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><ul><li>Choose an important and urgent challenge</li><li>Assemble a diverse team of specialized people. Have 1-2 Deciders (leads)</li><li>Prepare supplies in advance (lots of Post-Its!) </li></ul><h2 id="monday-map">Monday: Map</h2><p>The first day will be spent crafting a clear question that you&apos;d like to address by the end of the sprint. But first, you&apos;ll need to understand your company&apos;s long-term goals. Start with a question like this: &quot;Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be six months, a year, or even five years from now?&quot;</p><h3 id="uncover-underlying-assumptions-morning">Uncover Underlying Assumptions (morning)</h3><p>When creating your goal, you were probably quite optimistic about the future. But there are dangerous assumptions that you took to get there. The next step is to turn each assumption into a question, which you will then be answering by the end of the sprint. Think about the following:</p><ul><li>What questions do we want to answer in this sprint?</li><li>To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true?</li><li>Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might have caused this?</li></ul><h3 id="create-a-map">Create a Map</h3><p>The map will show your customers moving through every step of your service or product and will help you narrow your broad challenge into a specific goal later on. It also lays out how everything fits together, so it will be easier to structure your solutions sketches and prototypes later on.</p><p>On a giant white board, create your map:</p><ol><li><strong>List the actors</strong> (on the left). The &quot;actors&quot; are important characters in your story</li><li><strong>Write the ending </strong>(on the right). It&apos;s easier to figure this out than the middle steps</li><li><strong>Words and arrows in between</strong>. It&apos;s not art, keep it functional</li><li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>. There should be around 5 to 15 steps. Otherwise, it&apos;s too complicated</li><li><strong>Ask for help. </strong>Keep asking your team if the map makes sense</li></ol><h3 id="ask-the-experts-afternoon">Ask the Experts (afternoon)</h3><p>Get your team to individually interview people with specialized knowledge about your solution. Information is asymmetrically distributed across the company, and you&apos;ll need people who can pick up on easily missed details.</p><p>Here&apos;s who to talk to:</p><p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Talk with the &quot;Decider&quot; about questions like &quot;What will make this project a success&quot;, &quot;What&apos;s our unique advantage or opportunity&quot;, and &quot;What&apos;s the biggest risk&quot;</p><p><strong>Voice of the Customer: </strong>Find the person who knows the customer the best and can explain their perspective</p><p><strong>How Things Word:</strong> Who best understands the mechanics of your product? How does everything fit together?</p><p><strong>Previous Efforts: </strong>Sometimes, people already thought about a similar problem and may have some experience with attempting to solve them.</p><h3 id="how-might-we">How Might We</h3><p>While listening to the experts, note any interesting concepts and create a &quot;How Might We&quot; note on a Post-it. These are questions that could be interesting to solve, like &quot;HMW - Structure key info for screening patients?&quot;. Write in big markets so it forces you to be concise, and so that it can be seen easily.</p><ol><li>Write a &quot;How Might We&quot; on a Post-it by yourself</li><li>Stick it onto a wall when everyone is done</li><li>Vote silently with sticker &quot;dots&quot;. Each person gets two dots, while the Decider gets four dots.</li><li>Select the ones with multiple votes and use those targets to guide the rest of the sprint</li></ol><h3 id="pick-the-target">Pick the Target</h3><p>The final task for Monday is to choose the target for your sprint. Who is the most important customer, and what is the most critical experience for them? The &quot;How Might We&quot; notes can often make this decision obvious, but the Decider is always the one who gets the final say&#x2013;this is the biggest opportunity to do something great.</p><p>If the decider wants help, use a straw poll. Everyone should write their vote on a piece of paper, and after the votes are tallied, there should be a discussion on any big differences in opinion. The decider can now make their call.</p><p>Now that you have identified a long-term goal and question to answer, everyone will be ready for the next step: it&apos;s time to come up with some solutions.</p><h2 id="tuesday-sketch">Tuesday: Sketch</h2><p>Not gonna lie, I wrote everything above about 4 months ago, and I don&apos;t remember the book in as much depth.</p><p>The goal for this day is to generate a wide range of potential solutions. You start by reviewing what you did yesterday, and then each person will individually <em>sketch</em>, following a four-step process: notes, ideas, crazy 8s, and solution sketch.</p><ol><li><strong>Notes: </strong>Have the team walk around the room and take notes to refresh their memories before committing to a solution. Feel free to research specific details from the company&apos;s own product. This takes about twenty minutes, and then spend three minutes at the end reviewing everything.</li><li><strong>Ideas: </strong>Jot rough ideas, fill a sheet of paper with doodles, diagrams, stick figures, etc. Take twenty minutes with this and then review at the end for three minutes.</li><li><strong>Crazy 8s: </strong>Each person takes their strongest ideas and rapidly sketches eight variations in eight minutes. This promotes potential breakthroughs.</li><li><strong>Solution Sketch: </strong>Sketch a three-panel of the final solution to be looked at and judged by others. It&apos;s the final sketch!</li></ol><h2 id="wednesday-decide">Wednesday: Decide</h2><p>Today you&apos;ll evaluate ideas and decide on the solution that will be prototyped. There&apos;s a five-step process.</p><ol><li><strong>Art museum:</strong> Put the solution sketches on the wall with masking tape</li><li><strong>Heat map: </strong>Look at all the solutions in silence, and use dot stickers to mark interesting parts</li><li><strong>Speed critique: </strong>Quickly discuss the highlights of each solution, and use sticky notes to capture big ideas</li><li><strong>Straw poll: </strong>Each person chooses one solution, and votes for it with a dot sticker</li><li><strong>Supervote: </strong>The Decider makes the final decision, with more stickers!</li></ol><h2 id="thursday-prototype">Thursday: Prototype</h2><p>Now it&apos;s time to build a prototype that can be tested with real users. It&apos;s much more effective and easier to fake it rather than build the real thing. It&apos;ll emulate what your product will actually do, without needing the complex implementation and lack of polish.</p><p>Here&apos;s one way to do this.</p><ol><li><strong>Pick the right tools: </strong>Often, your usual tools are too slow. Use something like Apple&apos;s Keynote that can mimic what you want quickly. I&apos;d probably use Figma.</li><li><strong>Divide and conquer: </strong>Makers will create individual components, while Stitchers will put them together. Writers make the content reasonable (we <em>hate</em> lorem ipsum).</li><li><strong>Stich it together: </strong>Make sure fake content is consistent throughout the app</li><li><strong>Do a trial run: </strong>Do it around 3pm to give you enough time to fix it.</li></ol><h2 id="friday-test">Friday: Test</h2><p>Now it&apos;s time to learn from watching/interviewing users. There should generally be around five interviewees.</p><p>Here&apos;s how you should run them.</p><ol><li><strong>Friendly welcome: </strong>People need to feel comfortable to be honest and open, so start with something like &quot;Thanks for coming in today! Your feedback is really important to us&quot;</li><li><strong>Context questions:</strong> Ask about the customer&apos;s background so you get a better idea on who they are and how they&apos;d user your product</li><li><strong>Introduce the prototype:</strong> &quot;Would you like to see the prototype? I didn&apos;t design it so I won&apos;t be hurt by your feedback. Also think aloud!&quot;</li><li><strong>Tasks and nudges: </strong>&quot;What do you expect that will do? What is this for?&quot;. Just gauge their reactions.</li><li><strong>Quick debrief: </strong>&quot;How does this product compare to what you do now? What did you wish was different?&quot;</li></ol><p>In general, you should be watching these interviews together and taking notes as a team (on a giant whiteboard). Look for patterns in reactions and see if they answer the questions you came up with on Monday.</p><p>The best part is that you can&apos;t lose. Either you&apos;re on the right track, or you only spent five days exploring a tangent.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Now you can go test your ideas quickly! I won&apos;t use this for a while since I don&apos;t have a startup nor do I have a huge team. But what I do have is a Stanford interview tomorrow, so I&apos;m going to sleep now and then I&apos;ll have a great time talking with this guy!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gunn Matchomatics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Disrupting a (potentially) million-dollar company in two days.

All of these matches (along with identifying data such as name, gender, grade) are flattened into an array and stored in a new <code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>To find the match-compatibility score, we can use Dylan Lu&apos;s magical love-matching algorithm. We give &quot;points&quot; for questions that are answered the same or very closely, and we give extra points for matching &quot;dependent&quot; questions (for example, I answered that I prefer girls with brown hair, and a girl answered they have brown hair).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/code-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gunn Matchomatics" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="1552" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/code-1.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/code-1.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/code-1.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/code-1.png 1628w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dylan Lu&apos;s Magical Love-Matching Algorithm</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that we&apos;ve matched everyone, we&apos;ll need to convert the outputted <code>.csv</code> file into something printable and pretty.

<p>The <code>template.html</code> file is basically a giant wrapper that includes the basic boilerplate HTML needed and brings in Tailwind. We take all our data and pass it to a new <code>person.html</code>, which presents it in a pretty page format.</p>

I was a little skeptical&#x2014;<em>when was the last time he hung out with a college friend in California?</em>  <em>and why can&apos;t he get an Uber?</em>&#x2014;but I decided it wasn&apos;t that big of a deal. Then we got there, and I saw who it actually was: my little cousins, aunt, and uncle!</p><p>I missed my little cousins and aunt and uncle, so I was really excited and surprised to see them make a last-minute trip all the way from Beijing. My grandparents, on the other hand, burst out in tears. The whole family was together, and everyone was happy.</p><h2 id="before-christmas">Before Christmas</h2><p>I&apos;m not gonna lie, I left my Econ final an hour early because I was incredibly unmotivated to continue the test. I then played Elden Ring for 3 hours when I got home.</p><p>Speaking of Elden Ring, that&apos;s what I did literally all day for the next days, because I was super sad about <em>something.</em></p><p>But then I got over it. And I started writing my college apps again.</p><h2 id="christmas">Christmas</h2><p>Even though my parents made it absolutely clear that we would not get any gifts this year (the iPhone for our birthdays was good enough!), they called my sister and I down in the morning, and I got a 2TB SSD drive! I was genuinely excited, and it felt good knowing that my dad cared enough to surprise me with something I actually wanted.</p><p>My uncle (Yen Yen) got me cologne. I never thought about using cologne before, but, in my uncle&apos;s words, it&apos;s time for me to be a man now. So I started to wear it every day, and I think it smells pretty good!</p><p>Best of all, I now had enough Christmas + Birthday money to buy my latest toy: the iPad Pro. Why? Because now I can write all my notes digitally, and I can use it as a second monitor for my Macbook at school. My dad said that was a very gimmicky reason to drop $1k, but as they say, &quot;spend a lot on things you care about, but really save when it&apos;s something else.&quot; I&apos;m paraphrasing and I don&apos;t remember where I read it, but you get the point. Of course, that also meant I spent money on a &quot;paper&quot; screen protector with a special Apple pencil tip, and a really snug magnetic case/stand.</p><p>But now that I have an iPad Pro (and have joined the &quot;Macbook Pro, iPhone Pro, Airpods Pro, and iPad Pro&quot; family), I actually use it for things I&apos;d never thought I would. First off, my dad bought a recipe-making app, so I&apos;m learning to cook with it. I&apos;ve made chicken quesadillas so far (which are <em>so </em>good), and I&apos;m moving my way up to steak eventually. My dad also has Procreate, which is a drawing app. I&apos;m doing this thing where I draw a little bit (almost) everyday, and then see where I end up in a year/several months. Right now, I&apos;m drawing things from Zelda, Dragon Ball Z, and Elden Ring, and I&apos;ll hopefully get better as I progress.</p><p>To end Christmas, the whole family sang, I played violin (after not touching it for 6+ years), Jocelyn played clarinet, and Evelyn and Kevin played piano. Wai Po also gave us a math challenge for $100, and of course, I won it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765256670149345290/1194526466965250058/IMG_4448.jpg?ex=65b0ac76&amp;is=659e3776&amp;hm=d5b3d0eaad0920b5b2c82b77c89119bdcc231d2104cfddc0ab1751bd7ced52d2&amp;" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I&apos;m a Pro</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1470" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/01/IMG_4505.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First Quesadilla</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-day-after">The Day After</h2><p>We went to Ruby Hill to eat lunch and play golf with Tyler Wong&apos;s family.

Since we had 10 people, they gave us the VIP seating, which had a remote control spinny table and a private room. The duck was like $200 bro.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765256670149345290/1194526467749589002/IMG_4440.jpg?ex=65b0ac77&amp;is=659e3777&amp;hm=c625ec887338a19698a1eca98d7d068d55cd66ca5b69284d7aa14c90735e318d&amp;" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Kevin can drive?</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765256670149345290/1194526762697240576/IMG_4443.jpg?ex=65b0acbd&amp;is=659e37bd&amp;hm=de7bfde944c6cdf8418ac2782acfa9f02cbb2342256b86fadeda241ea1b7134f&amp;" class="kg-image" alt="Best Christmas Break Ever?" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Duck</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="before-new-years">Before New Years</h2><p>Now that I had my fun, it was time to get back on the college application grind. Jiu Jiu and Jiu Ma were nice enough to give feedback on my essays, leading us to an &quot;EE&quot; day&#x2014;exercise and essay day. Because the day before they left, that&apos;s all we did. Literally, from when I woke up at 7 AM to when I slept at 2 AM.</p><p>But looking back, EE day relieved a lot of future stress. I finished Harvard and MIT (both basically from scratch), Stanford, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia.  I felt more productive that day than in the preceding two months, and the amount of essays I churned showed it. I think stress is a great motivator.</p><p>Oh, and I also got a new book: &quot;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck<em>.&quot; </em>But counter-intuitively, it&apos;s all about giving the right fucks: &quot;While not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it&apos;s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood&quot; (12).</p><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">&quot;While not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it&apos;s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood&quot;</blockquote><p>I love that quote.</p><h3 id="before-my-cousins-leave">Before My Cousins Leave</h3><p>I almost forgot the biggest thing.

That&apos;s probably the most exciting part of the entire break.</p><h2 id="new-years">New Years</h2><p>Not gonna lie, I lost track of time and played Elden Ring through the new year. Whoops, but at least I saw Disney World&apos;s New Year celebration through FaceTiming my sister.</p><p>If you&apos;re me, you can look back at my digital journal and see what my 2024 resolutions were, maybe you accomplished them? (which in that case, good job man!) If not, you need more confidence.</p><h2 id="last-moments-before-school">Last Moments Before School</h2><p>By now, I&apos;m basically done with college apps, other than fine-tuning certain areas. That means that each day, I wake up, play Elden Ring/Pokemon SoulSilver (on my iPad with an emulator for the nostalgia of course), go to practice, and play more. I think I was genuinely addicted, checking in like 5 hours a day. I think I&apos;m good now though. Writing this post instead of playing is proof?</p><p>And on the final day before school started, I played golf with my friends. That was probably one of my worst performances, but fun nonetheless.</p><h2 id="second-semester-senior">Second Semester Senior</h2><p>No more stressing about school.

I was just thinking about how much stuff gets done in the first few months of school starting, which is why I pushed back my MIT application so I can have more time to write about them. Tomorrow is exactly one year after my last golf game with Dave, Ray, Bryan, and Grandpa at Ruby Hill, which is when I also asked Dave if he could help me with my LunchTrak project. Tomorrow is also the day I am meeting with Vypin&apos;s CEO to talk about potentially partnering up to deliver this LunchTrak solution for realsies. I&apos;m so scared, but I&apos;m excited; if everything goes well in the long term, I can definitely see myself getting 5% royalty on $100K a month. That&apos;s a life-changing amount of money.</p><p>It&apos;s also homecoming this week, which is crazy since it&apos;s the last one I&apos;ll ever have. Kinda sad really.</p><p>Edit (10/3/23): Damn bruh Vypin canceled the meeting and doesn&apos;t wanna do it anymore.</p><p>Edit 2 (1/11/23): Looking back on this old post, I talked about Vypin in my MIT, Stanford, and Ivys essays.

No more being lazy, no more being scared to take calls, no more avoiding people. Today, after my college counselor meeting with Ms. Ross, I called up Eric from Vypin. He suggested that we partner and use his prebuilt Bluetooth solution. My initial thoughts are that it could be good, but I&apos;m not so sure about how expensive it will be, how long the battery will last, and how big it will be. In these aspects, I think my design wins, but it clearly is not reliable.</p><p>And, I finally sent an email to Dave asking for a recommendation letter, something I&apos;ve put off for almost 2 months now (I have zero confidence in myself sometimes).

To be fully honest, I wanted to weasel my way out of it by saying something like &quot;Oh, I&apos;m taking a break&quot; or something similar, but they were persistent. When I told them that Bluetooth may not be the best solution, they suggested UWB and then asked whether we could talk over the phone. Coming off of my really nervous interview about Mr. Paley, I was scared, but I agreed. 10 minutes later I was on a call with Mark and Yuri.</p><h2 id="the-call">The Call</h2><p>Having pitched LunchTrak probably a hundred times already, explaining the gist of it was pretty easy, so I felt prepared. I then explained why Bluetooth wasn&apos;t the best solution because there&apos;s variation in signal strength and it isn&apos;t good when in a backpack. They responded by saying that their clients used Atmosic chips for asset tracking and it was perfectly fine, but agreed that having it in the backpack was tricky.</p><p>Both people were really nice and were willing to help brainstorm some ideas to solve my issues. I&apos;m actually really excited to get back into LunchTrak, and it&apos;s refreshing to know I&apos;m being productive again. Part of me wants to write about it in my college essay, but this is not why I&apos;m doing it. I am kinda nervous about college apps though. Regardless, there is a hard deadline soon because I will be graduating and will therefore not be physically present to debug and work with PAUSD (unless of course...)</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>Am I going back in? I hope so, and I hope that I can think about expanding the product to other use cases, not just the lunch line. Also, having it be a mobile app would make life a lot easier for the students, which might be an important requirement.</p><p>Dylan, please tell me that you didn&apos;t waste your senior year. This is your last year where you can start a &quot;business&quot; and everyone will support you because you are young. Also have fun and enjoy it. Isn&apos;t it crazy?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I spent 10 hours on the perfect Common App intro]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Wanna see me slowly lose my mind over 10 hours of writing?

A couple of days into the book, I was finally able to bring myself to lift at the gym every single day, and I still do it. Here&apos;s how this book can do the same for you.</p><h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2><p>Habits are incredibly powerful, and they determine who you are as a person. Getting 1% better every day will make you 37x better in a year. Sometimes, however, it is hard to get into a good habit or get rid of a bad one. The problem is not that you don&apos;t want to change, it&apos;s that you don&apos;t have the right system. There are 4 different &quot;laws&quot; to help you fix that.</p><h2 id="the-1st-law-make-it-obvious">The 1st Law: Make It Obvious</h2><p>If you want to go to the gym, prepare your gym bag and put it where you will always see it. By making the habit &quot;obvious&quot;, you are less likely to forget it. Moreover, it is easier to form new habits in new environments, since you are not fighting against old cues.</p><p>On the flip side, made bad habits invisible. If you play too much video games, maybe put the controller under your desk where you can&apos;t see it. This way, you will not be reminded about it all the time.</p><h3 id="habit-stacking">Habit Stacking</h3><p>This is a technique to make new habits obvious. The formula is &quot;After I [current habit], I will [new habit]&quot;. Basically, you will perform your new habit before or after something you already do, like eating breakfast or brushing your teeth.</p><h2 id="the-2nd-law-make-it-attractive">The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive</h2><p>The anticipation of a reward drives us to action, and greater anticipation leads to more dopamine in the brain. Make your &quot;hard&quot; habits attractive by bundling things you <em>need</em> to do with things you <em>want </em>to do. For me, I need to do more push-ups, so I do as many push-ups as I can before I allow myself to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> (I do push-ups way too many times a day).</p><p>The inversion of this law is to make bad habits <em>unattractive</em>. One way is to highlight the benefits of avoiding the bad habit.</p><h3 id="use-other-people-to-shape-your-habits">Use Other People to Shape Your Habits</h3><p>We humans tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (friends and family), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). The easiest way to build better habits is to join groups or cultures where your desired habit is the norm. For example, my closest friends started going to the gym every day. Now, I go to the gym every day.</p><h2 id="the-3rd-law-make-it-easy">The 3rd Law: Make it Easy</h2><blockquote>&quot;Make it easy&quot; - Nathan Levy</blockquote><p>Stop planning and trying to be perfect. You learn more from taking action, which brings results and habits. You don&apos;t get fit by talking to your personal trainer; you do it by working out.</p><p>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is far less important than the number of times you actually do it. It doesn&apos;t matter if you exercise once a week for a year; doing five times a week for two months will probably form the habit better.</p><h3 id="the-law-of-least-effort">The Law of Least Effort</h3><p>Similar to &quot;make it obvious&quot;, we are more likely to perform our habits if it is easy and frictionless (we tend to gravitate towards the option that requires the least amount of work). Prime your environment to put your gym bag at the front door, putting your book at the dinner table, putting healthy snacks in the fridge, or anything that would make your good habit easier. On the other hand, make bad habits really hard to do. If you unplug your TV and put it in the garage, you probably will think twice before mindlessly binge-watching Netflix.</p><h3 id="two-minute-rule">Two Minute Rule</h3><p>Start small, and build up slowly. No new habit should take more than two minutes to perform. I used to be scared of going to the gym because of how many other people were there. On the first three days, I decided to drive over, do 3 sets, and then drive back home; it was incredibly short, but that made me willing to go through with it.</p><p>Standardize before you optimize. You can&apos;t improve a habit that doesn&apos;t exist.</p><h3 id="automation">Automation</h3><p>Automate your habits so that you don&apos;t need to think about performing good ones and avoiding bad ones. For example, you could set a screen time limit on your phone if you use too much social media. Or, you could use a meal delivery service to ensure you cook healthy foods. Technology is the best way to automate your habits.</p><p>Invest in one-time actions that lock in good habits. I bought a 3D printer so that I would continue creating and developing cool projects. A better example from the book is to enroll in an automatic savings plan.</p><h2 id="the-4th-law-make-it-satisfying">The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying</h2><p>Our bad habits often have immediate gratification, but lead to long-term unhappiness. Good habits are the opposite, which is why our brains sometimes want to avoid them. The secret to getting a habit to stick is to feel successful after performing a habit, even if it&apos;s just a little bit (maybe use an app to track your progress). The rule is: <em>What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</em></p><h3 id="habit-tracking">Habit Tracking</h3><p>Tracking your habits makes them obvious, attractive, and satisfying. You can use habit stacking to make sure you track your habits: &quot;After I [habit], I will [track my habit]&quot;. You don&apos;t, however, need to track everything. Some metrics are vanity metrics and do not help you find results. Wait you don&apos;t know what <em>vanity metrics</em> are? Read my post on <a href="https://blog.dylanlu.com/the-lean-startup/?ref=localhost">The Lean Startup</a>.</p><p>Important: Never miss a good habit twice. Get back on track as soon as possible to keep your streak alive.</p><h3 id="accountability-partner">Accountability Partner</h3><p>Create a <em>habit contract</em> with a partner to keep you both accountable. This is just a verbal or written commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don&apos;t follow through. The best way to make a bad habit unsatisfying is to immediately painful at the moment.</p><p>You can even automate this process. Maybe if you don&apos;t wake up at 6:30 AM to run, your phone will automatically post on Instagram that says &quot;I&apos;m too lazy to wake up early and I will pay $5 to the first person who DMs me&quot;.</p><h2 id="advanced-tactics">Advanced Tactics</h2><h3 id="pick-the-right-habit">Pick the Right Habit</h3><p>Genes influence your personality and behavior, so you have a natural advantage/disadvantage in some areas. It is a lot easier to stick with a habit that matches your personality, so pick the ones that work for you.</p><p>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. If you have a natural talent for a particular area, you will likely find progress fun and easy. But if you pick the wrong habit, it&apos;s really hard to succeed.</p><p> Here are some questions to find your habit:</p><ul><li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</li><li>What makes me lose track of time?</li><li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</li><li>What comes naturally to me?</li></ul><p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us <em>what </em>to work hard on.</p><h3 id="stay-motivated">Stay Motivated</h3><p>Use the <em>Goldilocks Rule</em> to stay motivated. The rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. Hit flow state to become fully immersed in an activity.</p><p>Habits will eventually become boring and you will want to quit&#x2014;even if you are making good progress. The only way to become excellent is to fall in love with boredom; you must be fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. Anyone can work hard when they are motivated, but going when the work isn&apos;t exciting is what makes the difference.</p><h3 id="the-downside-of-good-habits">The Downside of Good Habits</h3><p>Once you practice enough, a habit becomes automatic. This dynamic can prevent you from thinking about how to get even better. The moment you feel like you mastered an activity is when you are at risk of complacency. You need deliberate practice on top of automatic habits to achieve the next level of mastery</p><p>In order to be conscious of your performance over time, you should reflect and review a couple of times a year. Doing so will prevent the gradual slide of your abilities over time.</p><p>Building habits early on can help you build your desired identity, but your new beliefs can also hold you back from the next level of growth. Keep your identity small and do not cling too tightly to a single identity. If your identity is &quot;star Varsity player&quot;, what happens after you graduate high school? Keep your identity flexible.</p><h2 id="final-remarks-71323">Final Remarks (7/13/23)</h2><p>I liked this book a lot because of how easy and effective it was to change my habits. Rereading parts of the book for this post reminded me of some key details that helped me continue to code every day even though it was getting a little boring. My improvement will compound as I continue to exercise my habits, and I know I will be a lot better in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
