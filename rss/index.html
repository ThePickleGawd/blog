I finally learned how to use Fusion 360.</p><p>For a couple of months now, I&apos;ve been way too lazy to learn new complex software for my LunchTrak project, causing me to use online tools like EasyEDA (for PCB design) and TinkerCAD (for 3d printing). Yes, I still use EasyEDA because my schematics are so simple and because their platform gives me free coupons, but it may be beneficial in the future to learn something like KiCAD. Well today, I finally broke out of my shell and took on Fusion360. If you&apos;d like, here&apos;s my old case with TinkerCAD.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="1017" height="621" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-6.png 1017w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The lid doesn&apos;t work, and it&apos;s a pain changing things</figcaption></figure><p>I then started to open Fusion360. I&apos;m not gonna lie, I did not want to watch a 60-minute tutorial on how to use it, so I just messed around and clicked things until I got things to look how I wanted them to. For the first hour, I didn&apos;t even realize you could change the dimensions of sketches and boxes, so I had to delete and restart the entire model when I made a mistake. Another thing that was kind of trippy was the orthographic view. Having done a lot of development with Unity and Blender, it is incredibly mind-twisting to see the models from such a weird angle (edit: as I took the picture below, I accidentally figured out how to change it to perspective mode, which is what I&apos;m used to). I ended up just using the box at the top right to get the right view that I wanted.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="565" height="328"><figcaption>The box thing is really nice</figcaption></figure><p>For my new lid design, I decided to copy off of the case that Dave gave me, which has a little sliding thing. This is what I ended up with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="442" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-8.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-8.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/image-8.png 1600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-8.png 2261w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sliding thingy</figcaption></figure><p>And it looks pretty cool. I also added some text to make the case more personal, and I added a hole for the buttons. In a later version, I&apos;ll probably embed the buttons in the case or something cool like that. Here&apos;s the final product.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designing a Better LunchTrak Case with Fusion360" loading="lazy" width="1531" height="815" srcset="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-9.png 600w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image-9.png 1000w, https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/image-9.png 1531w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Final Product</figcaption></figure><p>That was pretty fun to make. I think I&apos;ll be using this software more often now since it has a lot of cool features. I think you can even design PCBs on it, but I&apos;m not sure.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Setting Up Ghost on GitHub Pages]]></title><description><![CDATA[Who wants to pay for a VPS anyway?]]></description><link>https://blog.dylanlu.com/setting-up-ghost-on-github-pages/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">641fd4802cc655268c7cd1b8</guid><category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dylan Lu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 16:02:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/ghost.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://blog.dylanlu.com/content/images/2023/03/ghost.png" alt="Setting Up Ghost on GitHub Pages"><p>After seeing some random guy on Youtube and his crazy MIT Maker Portfolio, I looked into his profile a little bit and found that he has his own static blog.

Oh well...</p><h2 id="setup-ghost">Setup Ghost</h2><p>To get started, I went to the <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/?ref=localhost">ghost docs</a> and followed the instructions. They had me install their ghost-cli and create a new ghost instance on my computer. After the setup finished, the ghost instance was ready to go, and I could access it on localhost:2368.</p><h2 id="generate-static-pages">Generate Static Pages</h2><p>Now the fun part.</p><p>I did some research and found ghost-static-site-generator (gssg). It looked promising, but when I installed it, I ran into some errors.
